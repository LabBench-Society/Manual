	abstract = {Objective
Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OIPN) is an unwanted side effect of oxaliplatin chemotherapy treatment. OIPN manifests in an acute phase that lasts a few days after injection and a persistent phase that may become chronic. Currently, there is no consensus about a clinically applicable, quantitative, and objective measure of OIPN.
Methods
Seventeen patients treated with oxaliplatin containing adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer, but otherwise healthy, were tested with six quantitative sensory tests (QST) and five large fibre perception threshold tracking (PTT) measures (quantified by, e.g., rheobase and electrotonus threshold) one hour before each of the 12 chemotherapy cycles given at two weeks’ intervals. These measures were repeated at 3, 6, and 12-month follow-ups. The temporal development of OIPN assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale, QST, and PTT measures was calculated by linear regression.
Results
The CTCAE score showed a tri-phasic increase during the treatment and remained increased during the follow-up. The vibration threshold (R = 0.25, p{\textless}0.001), the cold pain threshold (R = 0.17, p = 0.02), and the rheobase (R = 0.28, p {\textless} 0.001) increased during treatment, whereas the cold detection threshold (R=-0.16, p = 0.002) decreased. The cold pain threshold and the rheobase remained increased, and the cold detection and heat pain threshold remained decreased during follow-up.
Conclusions
Increased cold pain sensitivity and decreased large fibre sensitivity (increased rheobase) correlate to the persistent OIPN, whereas the CTCAE score assesses both acute and persistent OIPN. Furthermore, the novel PTT method assessed the nerve excitability changes caused by the oxaliplatin.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to compare two different instruments for assessing digital nerve function; a secondary aim was to determine interobserver agreement among emergency physicians by using static two-point testing of digital nerve function.
METHODS: This was a prospective, blinded, observational study of static two-point discrimination involving healthy volunteers aged 18-59 years. The authors compared two instruments (paper clip set or Disk-Criminator) to assess two-point discrimination of the index and long fingers of the dominant hand. For each subject, the initial investigator and initial testing instrument were randomized. Two-point testing was conducted at 4, 5, and 6 mm by using six randomly selected stimuli (1 or 2 points) for each distal phalanx tested. The study was designed to detect a 25\% difference in mean two-point distance with a power of 80\%.
RESULTS: Seventy-five subjects were entered into the study, of which two were excluded. Interinstrument agreement for a given investigator ranged from 77\% to 84\% for absolute agreement and 98\% to 100\% within 2 mm. Weighted kappa values for interobserver differences of 2 mm or less was 0.79 to 1.00. There was no statistically significant difference between instruments.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a clinically relevant threshold of 2 mm, the authors found that a properly calibrated set of paper clips performed as well as the Disk-Criminator.},

Introduction
Sensorimotor deficits can impair function and may be present in individuals with common upper extremity conditions.
Purpose of the study
To provide clinicians with an understanding of the usefulness of the assessments to evaluate sensorimotor function and the interventions reported in the literature to effect positive change in our patients with sensorimotor deficits affecting the hand and wrist.
Methods
A systematic search produced seventeen studies involving sensorimotor retraining and assessment of sensorimotor performance for the upper extremity.
Results
Sensorimotor interventions and assessments found in the literature vary in regards to their effectiveness in restoring sensorimotor function in subjects with a number of conditions that affect hand and wrist function.
Conclusions
There is a potential value of sensorimotor interventions for individuals with specific upper extremity conditions. There is a need for further studies to improve treatment of sensorimotor deficits and understanding of sensorimotor interventions.},

Structured literature synthesis.
Introduction
Hand therapists and researchers have numerous options when selecting outcome measures for patients with wrist pathologies. An evidence-based approach to determining which measures are used most often can inform choices.
Purpose of the Study
To describe how frequently outcome measures are used in recent randomized controlled trials of patients with wrist diagnoses. Identifying assessment design and related International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) domains provides additional consideration for selection.
Methods
Systematic PubMed and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature searches for the time frame between January 2005 and March 2015 captured measures used in randomized controlled trials researching wrist-specific fractures, ligament injuries, nerve injuries, arthritis/arthroplasty, or stress injuries/wrist pain.
Results
Three most frequent measures used within each diagnostic category are detailed with assessment design described and ICF domain identified. Across diagnoses, grip/pinch strength and Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand were the most frequently used physical and patient-reported outcome measures, respectively. The Jebsen–Taylor Hand Function Test was the most frequently used performance measure.
Discussion and Conclusions
Consideration of the evidence, ICF domains, wrist diagnoses, and assessment design can help hand therapists select the measure most appropriate for use.

	abstract = {Background and aims
Two-point discrimination threshold (TPDT) is increased in individuals with chronic low back pain. TPDT reference values and their determinants are required for clinical applications. Therefore, the aims of this research are to establish reference values for TPDT of the low back regions in healthy individuals, stratified for age, and to investigate the associations of demographic and anthropomorphic variables with TPDT.
Methods
Healthy individuals (n = 79) across four decades (Group-I:18–29; Group-II:30–39; Group-III:40–49; and Group-IV:50–59years) were recruited. A mechanical calliper tool was used to determine the low back TPDT (mm) using an adaptive staircase method. Descriptive statistics were calculated for TPDT for each age group. Paired t-tests (p ≤ 0.05) were used to assess within group differences in TPDT between body sides. Univariate and weighted least squared linear regression analyses were performed to investigate associations between TPDT estimates and demographics, and body mass index (BMI), waist hip ratio (WHR).
Results
Mean (SD) age = 38.3(12.2); 55 female; and 73 right lower limb dominant. Mean (SD) TPDT threshold for all age groups: right = 67.3(15.6), and left = 65.7(15.4). No significant differences between left and right sides of the low back except in group-IV (mean difference:5.6[0.7–10.5]; P = 0.028). A total of 18\% of TPDT variance (adjusted R2 = 0.183; β = 0.6; p = ≤0.001) of low back regions was explained by age with BMI and WHR weighted independently.
Conclusions
Age, BMI, and WHR were independently associated with TPDT of the low back, and the influence of age was significantly influenced by obesity indices.},

Dexterity was assessed by the strength-dexterity test, Box and Blocks, and Nine-Hole Peg Test, and the ABILHAND questionnaire. Sensation was measured by pinprick, cotton-wool, graphesthesia, and 2-point discrimination tests. Sensation in the paretic hand had strong association with paretic hand performance in the strength-dexterity test and Nine-Hole Peg Test and explained 13\% of the variance. Sensation in the nonparetic hand was associated with the results of the ABILHAND questionnaire. Among sensory tests, 2-point discrimination had the strongest association with dexterity tests. No significant correlations between sensation, pinch force, and dexterity tests were found for the nonparetic hand. The strength-dexterity test exhibited strong correlations with the other dexterity measures and with pinch force. There is an association between tactile sensation and dexterous performance in the paretic hand; activity level performance is associated with sensation in the nonparetic hand. The study supports the validity of the strength-dexterity test when applied in subjects in the chronic stage after stroke.},

	abstract = {Static two-point discrimination (S2PD) and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (SWM) tests are the most widely used tests for evaluation of sensory deterioration. It is a necessity to know the inter- and intra-tester reliability of these tests to determine the suitability of method. Another important point in evaluation of sensory deterioration is whether or not there is a reference point which can be compared with the test results. So, it is important to know the reliability of sensory evaluation tests on the healthy extremities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inter- and intra-tester reliability of the S2PD and SWM tests applied to the fingers of healthy individuals. One hundred and sixty three healthy fingers from 83 individuals were included into the study. An experienced orthopaedic surgeon and a physiotherapist examined all the individuals separately. The reliability of the S2PD test was found to be little and low. The reliability of the SWM test was determined as low and moderate. The reproducibility scores of both tests were at a poor level. Therefore, in the evaluation of states with sensory deterioration, the use of the healthy contralateral extremities as a standard reference point could be considered unreliable. Prognosis, grading or follow-up of treatment should not be made according to the results of the S2PD and SWM tests only. It would be more correct to use these tests as a diagnostic tool rather than quantitative follow-up for neurological function in pathological conditions.},

	abstract = {A progressive decline in upper limb function is associated with ageing and disease. In this cross-sectional study we assessed the performance of 367 healthy individuals aged of 20 to 95 years across a battery of upper limb clinical tests, which we have termed the upper limb Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA). The upper limb PPA was designed to quantify the performance of the multiple physiological domains important for adequate function in the upper extremities. Included are tests of muscle strength, unilateral movement and dexterity, position sense, skin sensation, bimanual coordination, arm stability, along with a functional task. We report age and gender normative values for each test. Test-retest reliability ranged from good to excellent in all tests (intra-class correlation coefficients from 0.65 to 0.98) with the exception of position sense (0.31). Ten of the thirteen tests revealed differences in performance between males and females, twelve showed a decline in performance with increasing age, and eight discriminated between older people with and without upper limb functional impairment. Furthermore, most tests showed good external validity with respect to age, an upper limb functional test and self-reported function. This profiling approach provides a reference range for clinical groups with upper limb sensory and motor impairments and may assist in identifying undiagnosed deficits in the general population. Furthermore, the tests are sufficiently reliable to detect motor impairments in people with compromised upper limb function and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions.},

	abstract = {Purpose 
        The purpose of this study was to present the sensitivity and specificity of 6 clinical tests for the diagnosis of digital nerve injury. The clinical tests are as follows: light touch, pinprick, static and dynamic 2-point discrimination (D2PD), Semmes-Weinstein monofilament, and wrinkle test.
        Methods 
        We reviewed the charts of all the patients who were admitted to our department with hand lacerations and/or suspicions of digital nerve injury that were examined before surgery with the 6-sensation test, comparing the results to the surgical findings.
        Results 
        The study included 70 patients with 85 injured nerves overall. Of the 85 nerves, 51 were found with full cut, 9 with partial cut, and 25 with no cut. Only 2 variables were significantly associated with the study outcome: D2PD {\textgreater} 4 (P = 0.0141, odds ratio = 3.9, 95\% confidence interval = 1.3–11.8, sensitivity = 80.7\%, specificity = 48\%) and wrinkle test (P = 0.0098, odds ratio = 4.0, 95\% confidence interval = 1.4–11.6, sensitivity = 69.5\%, specificity = 62.5\%).
        Multivariable logistic regression included these variables and revealed the predictive probability for a nerve injury to be 92\% if both risk factors exist and 43\% if none of these risk factors exist. If one risk factor exists, the predictive probability for a cut is still very high (75\%).
        Conclusions 
        The combination of positive wrinkle test and D2PD {\textgreater} 4 gave a predictive probability for a nerve injury as 92\% in the cases in our study and should be considered in the evaluation of patients with hand lacerations and suspicions of digital nerve injury.},

The newer tactile acuity test of TPE was also performed between both examiners at the three location sites.Results: Inter-rater reliability (ICC 2, k) for the descending-ascending method was 0.75, 0.79, and 0.67 for the neck, hand, and foot, respectively. For the descending with randomization method, ICC values were 0.74, 0.50, and 0.69 for the three body regions respectively. The minimal detectable difference for the neck was 28.8 and 32.7 mm, hand 5.3 and 10.8 mm, and foot 12.3 and 12.4 mm for the descending-ascending and randomization methods. TPE showed poor reliability for neck and hand (0.27 and 0.15), but moderate reliability for the foot (0.67). Time to perform the TPD test were between 54 and 108 seconds, while TPE was 12 seconds.Conclusion: The modified TPD testing methods demonstrated similar reliability to previous research, even with reduced runs allowing for increased efficiency in performing the test. The TPE method showed poor reliability, so caution should be applied when using this method.},

	abstract = {Background: Digit replantation affords the opportunity to restore hand function following amputation. To date, however, few studies have evaluated functional outcomes following replantation. Therefore, it was the objective of this study to perform a meta-analysis to better characterize the predictors of hand function. Methods: A literature search was performed using the PubMed database to identify studies that focused on digit amputation/replantation and functional outcomes. Studies were evaluated for patient- and injury-related factors and their respective effects on clinical outcomes of sensation, grip strength, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) scores. Statistical analysis was conducted across the pooled data set to identify significant trends. Results: Twenty-eight studies representing 618 replanted digits were included in this study. We found the average grip strength was 78.7\% (relative to contralateral), the average 2-point discrimination (2PD) was 7.8 mm, and the average DASH score was 12.81. After conducting statistical analysis, we found patients with more proximal injuries had lower grip strength scores (P {\textless} .05). We found 2PD scores were influenced by age, mechanism of injury, and amputation level (P {\textless} .05). Finally, we found DASH scores after replantation were predicted by mechanism of injury and level of amputation (P {\textless} .05). The following variables did not influence outcomes: gender, tobacco use, ischemia time, and digit number. Conclusions: Digit replant does not restore premorbid hand function but does result in adequate hand function. Expected functional outcomes following replant should be considered in the decision-making process. These data can help risk-stratify patients, guide postreplant expectations, and influence the decision for replantation.},

	abstract = {Background \&amp; aims. It is generally accepted that there arises a decrease in sensory integrity with aging. Despite so much emphasis on the lower extremity, studies have not focused sufficiently on agerelated sensory changes in the hands and wrists. The aim of our study is to evaluate the hand and wrist sensory parameters of young and geriatric people and to reveal the sensorial differences in young and geriatric hands.
Methods. 60 elderly and 60 young individuals were included in our study. The 3D Motion Sensor mOOver® was used to assess joint position sense. Baseline Pneumatic Bulb Dynamometer® device was used to assess the grip sensitivity. The hand pressure sensitivities was evaluated with Stabilizer Pressure Biofeedback®. The vibration senses, sensory threshold and two-point discrimination were evaluated. Results. Joint position sense error rates of all movements of dominant and nondominant wrists and errors of grip and pressure sensitivity, sensory threshold and two points discrimination distance were found lower in youths (p = 0.000). Sense of vibration’s duration was found higher in youths (p = 0.000).
Conclusions. Our results are of great importance in terms of demonstrating how aging affects sensory changes in the hand and wrist. Adequate and accurate assessment of the sensory parameters in the hand and wrist will be able to enable the accurate detection of pathologies that may be encountered in this region. This data will help professionals working in the fields of geriatric rehabilitation and hand rehabilitation to predict changes in sensory parameters and to design protective rehabilitation and treatment programs.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the reliability (intra and inter) of two-point discrimination (2PD) test in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) patients. Participants: Eighty-six adults with unilateral right hand CTS. Methods: Two examiners performed measurements of 2PD sensation (using Dellon discriminator) on the first three fingers on both hands. The first examiner performed three series of measurements at 1-minute intervals. After 7 days, measurements were repeated by the same examiner (intra-rater). For inter-rater reliability, the examination (by second examiner) was also repeated after 7 days. Results: For the first measurement, inter-rater reliability (ICC2,1) at the affected site ranged from 0.96 to 0.97; values at the non-affected site ranged from 0.79 to 0.89. Analysis of the averages of two measurements (ICC2,2) yielded values at the affected site of 0.98; values at the non-affected site ranged from 0.92 to 0.94. The average of two measurements reduces the smallest detectable difference (SDD) value {\textless} 1 mm in all cases. Intra-rater reliability was at least good for all tested fingers for the first measurement, but to record SDD {\textless} 1 mm it is necessary to use an average of the first two measurements. Conclusions: The execution of two repeated measurements provides adequate reliability in measurements of 2PD test in CTS patients. For clinical trials, we recommend using at least the average of two measurements of 2PD, which reduce SDD (below 1 mm). This may be particularly important in assessing the effectiveness of therapy.},

	abstract = {Background
Deficits in the sensorimotor system and its peripheral and central processing of the affected body part might be a contributing factor to chronic low back pain (CLBP). Hence, sensorimotor assessment is important. Valid and reliable sensorimotor measurement instruments are needed.
Objective
To investigate the reliability and validity of sensorimotor measurement instruments for people with chronic low back pain (CLBP).
Design
Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Methods
The review was undertaken using the COSMIN guidelines. Databases were searched for studies investigating the clinimetric properties of sensorimotor tests in people with CLBP. The methodological study quality was rated by two independent reviewers using the COSMIN 4-point rating checklist.
Results
Ten studies were included covering six sensorimotor measurement instruments with findings for reliability/measurement error, known-groups validity and convergent validity. The methodological quality ranged from poor to good, with only one study rated as good. There was insufficient evidence of enough quality to assess reliability/measurement error or convergent validity. Two-point discrimination, laterality judgement and movement control tests had moderate evidence supporting their ability to distinguish between healthy people and those with CLBP.
Conclusions
Two-point discrimination, laterality judgment and movement control tests demonstrate the greatest level of known-groups validity for people with CLBP. However, as the reliability of these measurement tools has yet to be established, this validity data should be interpreted cautiously. Further research is warranted to investigate the clinimetric properties of these sensorimotor techniques.},

The results also demonstrated interindividual variation in two-point discrimination for a given area of skin. In the majority of skin areas tested, mean values obtained from men and women were essentially the same. In several of the test areas, however, women were significantly better than men in their two-point discrimination ability. The observed intraindividual and interindividual variation suggests that although two-point testing is a useful clinical tool, caution is necessary when interpreting the results from patients with alterations in cutaneous sensibility.},

Two-point discrimination (TPD) is one method of quantitatively testing for loss of nerve function. The law of mobility for TPD is known for normal subjects in earlier studies but has not been studied for diabetic subjects. This is a pilot study to evaluate and plot the law of mobility for TPD among DM subjects.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater} \textbf{Methods} The Semmes Weinstein monofilament (SWMF) was used to measure the loss of protective sensation. An Aesthesiometer was used to find the TPD of several areas in upper and lower extremities for normal and diabetic subjects. All the subjects were screened for peripheral artery occlusive disease with ankle brachial pressure index (0.9 or above).{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater} \textbf{Results} TPD of normal and diabetic subjects for different areas of hands and legs from proximal to distal is evaluated for 18 subjects. TPD values decrease from proximal to distal areas. Vierodt’s law of mobility for TPD holds good for normal subjects in the hand and foot areas. The law of mobility for TPD in DM subjects holds well in the hand but doesn’t hold well in foot areas with or without sensation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater} \textbf{Conclusion} TPD is a quantitative and direct measure of sensory loss. The TPD value of diabetic subjects reveals that the law of mobility do not hold well for Diabetic subjects in foot areas. The significance of this result is that the TPD of the diabetic subjects could provide direct, cost effective and quantitative measure of neuropathy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Two-point discrimination is measured as an indicator of cortical reorganisation in musculoskeletal medicine. Nevertheless, data are lacking for the reliability of this measure in patients with non-specific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP). We aimed to quantify the intra- and inter-observer reliability of a novel protocol for measuring two-point discrimination in these patients. 35 participants (12 males, 23 females, mean age 52, SD 15 years) with NSCLBP were recruited. Three clinicians made 14 consecutive measurements of two-point discrimination with callipers. One of these clinicians repeated the assessment protocol within 7 d. During each measurement, the calliper width was widened in 5 mm increments until participants could consistently identify two points. Intra- and inter-observer agreement was quantified using mean difference, within-subject SD and limits of agreement (LOA). After using the first measurement for familiarisation, the mean of measurements 2–5 within an assessment resulted in the optimum compromise between clinic time constraints and acceptable intra-observer reliability; the within-subjects SD being 7.5 mm (LOA: 20.8 mm). Inter-observer reliability was generally poorer; requiring the mean of measurements 2–9 within an assessment for a similar within-subjects SD of 8.6 mm (LOA: 23.7 mm). It was estimated that these within-subjects SDs were small enough for a clinically-important change to be detected with a feasible sample size in future studies. The intra-observer reliability of our assessment protocol is acceptable for detecting a clinically relevant difference in two-point discrimination for future research purposes. Nevertheless, individual patient measurement variability is relatively high, especially between different clinicians.},

In accordance with earlier investigations, the units were separated into 4 groups, mainly on the basis of their adaptation and receptive field properties: RA, PC, SA I and SA II units. The extent of the receptive fields of 255 units were mapped with von Frey hairs. The fields of the RA and SA I units were of similar size with medians of 12.6 sq. mm and 11.0 sq. mm. In contrast, the fields of the SA II and PC units were about 5 and 10 times larger, respectively. A difference in size between fields from different skin regions was found only for the RA fields which were smaller the more distal the skin region. The distributions of the field sizes were positively skewed for all 4 unit types. A model was constructed of the population of RA and SA I fields within the various regions of the hand. The model was based on (i) an estimate of the densities of units reported in a previous study14, and (ii) the sizes of the receptive fields. The number and the spatial distribution of the fields which would be stimulated by indentations of simple and defined geometries were deduced from the model. The findings indicate that the RA and SA I units provide the information required for the psychophysical capacity of spatial analysis and discrimination in the glabrous skin of the hand.},

Eschewing complex central explanations, we hypothesized that this sex difference in somatosensory perception might result from simple physical differences between the fingers of women and men. To investigate, we tested 50 women and 50 men on a tactile grating orientation task and measured the surface area of the participants' index fingertips. In subsets of participants, we additionally measured finger skin compliance and optically imaged the fingerprint microstructure to count sweat pores. We show here that tactile perception improves with decreasing finger size, and that this correlation fully explains the better perception of women, who on average have smaller fingers than men. Indeed, when sex and finger size are both considered in statistical analyses, only finger size predicts tactile acuity. Thus, a man and a woman with fingers of equal size will, on average, enjoy equal tactile acuity. We further show that sweat pores, and presumably the Merkel receptors beneath them, are packed more densely in smaller fingers.},

	abstract = {Spatial acuity of the touch sense and its variation in aging came under psychophysical scrutiny at the fingertip and control body sites. Acuity is viewed as encompassing the discrimination of four features of simple stimulus configurations: (1) discontinuity (gaps in lines or disks), (2) locus on the skin, (3) length (or area), and (4) orientation (e.g., along or across the finger). Each of these dimensions of acuity serves uniquely in tactile perception, as illustrated in the structure of braille. For their measurement, psychophysical tests were developed and refined. These were aimed at freedom from bias, rapid estimation of acuity thresholds in hundreds of subjects, and eventual applicability to the whole body surface.Some 14 versions of the tests were administered in three experiments, yielding 1478 individual thresholds. Experiment I (15 young and 15 elderly subjects) and Experiment II (131 subjects, ages 18 to 87 years) shed light on the nature of discrimination of discontinuity and orientation. These mainly concern pitfalls of measurement and influence of exact stimulus configuration. Experiment III (115 subjects, ages 8 to 86 years) examined refined versions of tests for all four dimensions of acuity.Four principal findings emerged: (1) At all ages, thresholds for the four dimensions of acuity differ from one another in size—in order from smallest to largest: length, locus, orientation, and discontinuity. Exact sizes differ for transverse and longitudinal stimulus alignment. (2) All four acuity dimensions deteriorate with age, to a first approximation manifesting a constant increase in threshold of approximately 1\% per annum between ages 20 and 80 years. That similar rates of deterioration characterize all four dimensions in the fingertip suggests a common mechanism, possibly thinning of the same mediating receptor network. (3) Acuity at more central sites (forearm, lip) deteriorates more slowly than at the fingertip. (4) Individual differences in acuity abound, even after the effects of aging are discounted.},

	abstract = {Twenty-four subjects were studied before and up to 1 year after surgery that produced injury to a major sensory branch of the trigeminal nerve. We employed a battery of 11 psychophysical tests, in which the neural mechanisms underlying performance are understood, to study the basis of recovery following nerve injury. Immediately after nerve injury, sensation was profoundly impaired in all subjects. In the following weeks and months, the recovery of performance proceeded in an orderly fashion. Although the rates of recovery varied between subjects, the order of recovery between tasks did not. The recovery rates fell into three distinct categories. Recovery in one task, brush-stroke directional discrimination, was most rapid. Two weeks after nerve injury, 52\% of subjects could discriminate brush-stroke direction; by 3 months only one subject could not perform this task. The second category comprised recovery rates for pain thresholds for noxious heat, cold and mechanical stimuli, and to preinjury performance in tasks assessing touch and vibration detection, two-point discrimination, cooling detection and subjective magnitude estimation of mechanical force. The third, slowest group included recovery rates for warming detection and grating orientation discrimination. Early recovery to preinjury performance levels in the brush-stroke direction and one-point versus two-point discrimination tasks was correlated with later recovery to near normal performance in the grating orientation task. The grating orientation task was unique in providing a measure that corresponded consistently with the subjects' reports of sensory deficits. Our psychophysical findings are consistent with neurophysiological data showing that the major primary afferent fibre classes reinnervate the skin at a similar rate. A hypothesis that accounts for the psychophysical findings in this study is that differences in recovery rates between tasks is determined largely by their relative dependencies on functional innervation density. Alternative hypotheses are considered.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To revise the static and dynamic normative values for the two-point discrimination test and to examine its applicability and validity in patients with a polyneuropathy.
Methods: Two-point discrimination threshold values were assessed in 427 healthy controls and 99 patients mildly affected by a polyneuropathy. The controls were divided into seven age groups ranging from 20–29, 30–39,…, up to 80 years and older; each group consisted of at least 30 men and 30 women. Two-point discrimination examination took place under standardised conditions on the index finger. Correlation studies were performed between the scores obtained and the values derived from the Weinstein Enhanced Sensory Test (WEST) and the arm grade of the Overall Disability SumScore (ODSS) in the patients’ group (validity studies). Finally, the sensitivity to detect patients mildly affected by a polyneuropathy was evaluated for static and dynamic assessments.
Results: There was a significant age-dependent increase in the two-point discrimination values. No significant gender difference was found. The dynamic threshold values were lower than the static scores. The two-point discrimination values obtained correlated significantly with the arm grade of the ODSS (static values: r = 0.33, p = 0.04; dynamic values: r = 0.37, p = 0.02) and the scores of the WEST in patients (static values: r = 0.58, p = 0.0001; dynamic values: r = 0.55, p = 0.0002). The sensitivity for the static and dynamic threshold values was 28\% and 33\%, respectively.
Conclusion: This study provides age-related normative two-point discrimination threshold values using a two-point discriminator (an aesthesiometer). This easily applicable instrument could be used as part of a more extensive neurological sensory evaluation.},

This paper, together with its companion paper (Wichmann \& Hill, 2001), describes an integrated approach to (1) fitting psychometric functions, (2) assessing the goodness of fit, and (3) providing confidence intervals for the function’s parameters and other estimates derived from them, for the purposes of hypothesis testing. The present paper deals with the first two topics, describing a constrained maximum-likelihood method of parameter estimation and developing several goodness-of-fit tests. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we deal with two specific difficulties that arise when fitting functions to psychophysical data. First, we note that human observers are prone to stimulus-independent errors (orlapses). We show that failure to account for this can lead to serious biases in estimates of the psychometric function’s parameters and illustrate how the problem may be overcome. Second, we note that psychophysical data sets are usually rather small by the standards required by most of the commonly applied statistical tests. We demonstrate the potential errors of applying traditionalX2 methods to psychophysical data and advocate use of Monte Carlo resampling techniques that do not rely on asymptotic theory. We have made available the software to implement our methods.},

	abstract = {Tactile spatial acuity is enhanced in blindness, according to several studies, but the cause of this enhancement has been controversial. Two competing hypotheses are the tactile experience hypothesis (reliance on the sense of touch drives tactile-acuity enhancement) and the visual deprivation hypothesis (the absence of vision itself drives tactile-acuity enhancement). Here, we performed experiments to distinguish between these two hypotheses. We used force-controlled grating orientation tasks to compare the passive (finger stationary) tactile spatial acuity of 28 profoundly blind and 55 normally sighted humans on the index, middle, and ring fingers of each hand, and on the lips. The tactile experience hypothesis predicted that blind participants would outperform the sighted on the fingers, and that Braille reading would correlate with tactile acuity. The visual deprivation hypothesis predicted that blind participants would outperform the sighted on fingers and lips. Consistent with the tactile experience hypothesis, the blind significantly outperformed the sighted on all fingers, but not on the lips. Additionally, among blind participants, proficient Braille readers on their preferred reading index finger outperformed nonreaders. Finally, proficient Braille readers performed better with their preferred reading index finger than with the opposite index finger, and their acuity on the preferred reading finger correlated with their weekly reading time. These results clearly implicate reliance on the sense of touch as the trigger for tactile spatial acuity enhancement in the blind, and suggest the action of underlying experience-dependent neural mechanisms such as somatosensory and/or cross-modal cortical plasticity.},

	abstract = {An important unresolved question in sensory neuroscience is whether, and if so with what time course, tactile perception is enhanced by visual deprivation. In three experiments involving 158 normally sighted human participants, we assessed whether tactile spatial acuity improves with short-term visual deprivation over periods ranging from under 10 to over 110 minutes. We used an automated, precisely controlled two-interval forced-choice grating orientation task to assess each participant's ability to discern the orientation of square-wave gratings pressed against the stationary index finger pad of the dominant hand. A two-down one-up staircase (Experiment 1) or a Bayesian adaptive procedure (Experiments 2 and 3) was used to determine the groove width of the grating whose orientation each participant could reliably discriminate. The experiments consistently showed that tactile grating orientation discrimination does not improve with short-term visual deprivation. In fact, we found that tactile performance degraded slightly but significantly upon a brief period of visual deprivation (Experiment 1) and did not improve over periods of up to 110 minutes of deprivation (Experiments 2 and 3). The results additionally showed that grating orientation discrimination tends to improve upon repeated testing, and confirmed that women significantly outperform men on the grating orientation task. We conclude that, contrary to two recent reports but consistent with an earlier literature, passive tactile spatial acuity is not enhanced by short-term visual deprivation. Our findings have important theoretical and practical implications. On the theoretical side, the findings set limits on the time course over which neural mechanisms such as crossmodal plasticity may operate to drive sensory changes; on the practical side, the findings suggest that researchers who compare tactile acuity of blind and sighted participants should not blindfold the sighted participants.},

	abstract = {In touch as in vision, perceptual acuity improves with training to an extent that differs greatly across people; even individuals with similar initial acuity may undergo markedly different improvement with training. What accounts for this variability in perceptual learning? We hypothesized that a simple physical characteristic, fingertip surface area, might constrain tactile learning, because previous research suggests that larger fingers have more widely spaced mechanoreceptors. To test our hypothesis, we trained 10 human participants intensively on a tactile spatial acuity task. During 4 d, participants completed 1900 training trials (38 50-trial blocks) in which they discriminated the orientation of square-wave gratings pressed onto the stationary index or ring finger, with auditory feedback provided to signal correct and incorrect responses. We progressively increased task difficulty by shifting to thinner groove widths whenever participants achieved ≥90\% correct block performance. We took optical scans to measure surface area from the distal interphalangeal crease to the tip of the finger. Participants' acuity improved markedly on the trained finger and to a lesser extent on the untrained finger. Crucially, we found that participants' tactile spatial acuity improved toward a theoretical optimum set by their finger size; participants with worse initial performance relative to their finger size improved more with training, and posttraining performance was better correlated than pretraining performance with finger size. These results strongly support the hypothesis that tactile perceptual learning is limited by finger size. We suspect that analogous physical constraints on perceptual learning will be found in other sensory modalities.},

	abstract = {Two-point discrimination is widely used to measure tactile spatial acuity. The validity of the two-point threshold as a spatial acuity measure rests on the assumption that two points can be distinguished from one only when the two points are sufficiently separated to evoke spatially distinguishable foci of neural activity. However, some previous research has challenged this view, suggesting instead that two-point task performance benefits from an unintended non-spatial cue, allowing spuriously good performance at small tip separations. We compared the traditional two-point task to an equally convenient alternative task in which participants attempt to discern the orientation (vertical or horizontal) of two points of contact. We used precision digital readout calipers to administer two-interval forced-choice versions of both tasks to 24 neurologically healthy adults, on the fingertip, finger base, palm, and forearm. We used Bayesian adaptive testing to estimate the participants’ psychometric functions on the two tasks. Traditional two-point performance remained significantly above chance levels even at zero point separation. In contrast, two-point orientation discrimination approached chance as point separation approached zero, as expected for a valid measure of tactile spatial acuity. Traditional two-point performance was so inflated at small point separations that 75\%-correct thresholds could be determined on all tested sites for fewer than half of participants. The 95\%-correct thresholds on the two tasks were similar, and correlated with receptive field spacing. In keeping with previous critiques, we conclude that the traditional two-point task provides an unintended non-spatial cue, resulting in spuriously good performance at small spatial separations. Unlike two-point discrimination, two-point orientation discrimination rigorously measures tactile spatial acuity. We recommend the use of two-point orientation discrimination for neurological assessment.},

	abstract = {Diabetic neuropathy, with its major clinical sequels, notably neuropathic pain, foot ulcers, and autonomic dysfunction, is associated with substantial morbidity, increased risk of mortality, and reduced quality of life. Despite its major clinical impact, diabetic neuropathy remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Moreover, the evidence supporting a benefit for causal treatment is weak at least in patients with type 2 diabetes, and current pharmacotherapy is largely limited to symptomatic treatment options. Thus, a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is mandatory for translation into new diagnostic and treatment approaches. Improved knowledge about pathogenic pathways implicated in the development of diabetic neuropathy could lead to novel diagnostic techniques that have the potential of improving the early detection of neuropathy in diabetes and prediabetes to eventually embark on new treatment strategies. In this review, we first provide an overview on the current clinical aspects and illustrate the pathogenetic concepts of (pre)diabetic neuropathy. We then describe the biomarkers emerging from these concepts and novel diagnostic tools and appraise their utility in the early detection and prediction of predominantly distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Finally, we discuss the evidence for and limitations of the current and novel therapy options with particular emphasis on lifestyle modification and pathogenesis-derived treatment approaches. Altogether, recent years have brought forth a multitude of emerging biomarkers reflecting different pathogenic pathways such as oxidative stress and inflammation and diagnostic tools for an early detection and prediction of (pre)diabetic neuropathy. Ultimately, these insights should culminate in improving our therapeutic armamentarium against this common and debilitating or even life-threatening condition.},

Rather than focus stimulus sampling to estimate a single level of \%Yes or \%Correct, the current methods sample psychometric functions more broadly, to concurrently estimate sensitivity and decision factors, and thereby estimate thresholds that are independent of decision confounds. Developed for four tasks—(1) simple YN detection, (2) cued YN detection, which cues the observer's response state before each trial, (3) rated YN detection, which incorporates a Not Sure response, and (4) FC detection—the qYN and qFC methods yield sensitivity thresholds that are independent of the task's decision structure (YN or FC) and/or the observer's subjective response state. Results from simulation and psychophysics suggest that 25 trials (and sometimes less) are sufficient to estimate YN thresholds with reasonable precision (s.d. = 0.10–0.15 decimal log units), but more trials are needed for FC thresholds. When the same subjects were tested across tasks of simple, cued, rated, and FC detection, adaptive threshold estimates exhibited excellent agreement with the method of constant stimuli (MCS), and with each other. These YN adaptive methods deliver criterion-free thresholds that have previously been exclusive to FC methods.},

The Single Fiber Action Currents (SFACs) and the extracellular Single Fiber Action Potentials (SFAPs) are calculated using a generalized volume conduction model. Frequency-dependent conductivities, variations in the intracellular action potentials with recording temperature and axon conduction velocity, and the effects of axonal myelination are incorporated into the volume conduction calculation. We demonstrate how the propagation distance and the recording radius affect the simulated Compound Action Signals (CASs) of various nerve bundles. We also demonstrate how the frequency-dependent and-independent conductivities affect the CASs simulated by our model. For this simulation, some of the parameters for the nerve bundles and Conduction Velocity Distributions (CVDs) were obtained from the literature. In accompanying papers, we use the simulated CASs to investigate the effects of variations in the model parameters on the CVDs predicted by our inverse model.},

The slope of the linear regression line over all tetani (FIS) and the number of tetani whose force was above 50\% of the initial tetanus (FIN) were used to quantify fatigue. Results: FIS and FIN were significantly lower in high-frequency protocols. No effects on FIS and FIN were found for intensity and impulse width.

The specific neuroprosthetic or “functional” applications reviewed in this article include upper- and lower-limb motor movement for self-care tasks and mobility, respectively, bladder function, and respiratory control. Specific therapeutic applications include motor relearning, reduction of hemiplegic shoulder pain, muscle strengthening, prevention of muscle atrophy, prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis, improvement of tissue oxygenation and peripheral hemodynamic functioning, and cardiopulmonary conditioning.

Based on these theoretical predictions, it has been suggested that the stimulus pulse width parameter may be used to selectively recruit fibers of different sizes and that this selectivity should increase with increasing distance from the stimulus electrode. In this paper, a simulation study of the recruitment patterns of a population of motor nerve fibers with a histologically accurate fiber diameter distribution is presented. Nerve fiber excitation simulations coupled with a time varying field simulation suggest that, for surface stimulation, there is only a marginal selectivity achievable in the average nerve fiber diameter that is recruited across the range of commonly used stimulus pulse widths but this selectivity also increases with increased electrode distance. Experimental evidence consisting of estimates of nerve fiber diameter based on motor unit latency studies is also presented that is consistent with the predictions made by the electromagnetic field and nerve fiber excitation simulations.},

However, little is known concerning the effects of varying stimulation parameters on muscle function in humans. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which varying pulse duration and frequency altered torque production and fatigability of human skeletal muscle in vivo. Ten subjects underwent NMES-elicited contractions of varying pulse frequencies and durations as well as fatigue tests using stimulation trains of equal total charge, yet differing parametric settings at a constant voltage. Total charge was a strong predictor of torque production, and pulse trains with equal total charge elicited identical torque output. Despite similar torque output, higher- frequency trains caused greater fatigue. These data demonstrate the ability to predictably control torque output by simultaneously controlling pulse frequency and duration and suggest the need to minimize stimulation frequency to control fatigue.

However, the effect of varying transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES) parameters on MAT and discomfort level is poorly understood. Furthermore, limited information exists regarding the biopsychological factors that may impact MAT and discomfort. The primary aims of this study were to compare the effects TES protocol with varying levels of pulse duration (300 μs vs 700 μs) and frequency (30 Hz vs 80 Hz) on the MAT and discomfort in healthy older adults. The exploratory aim of this study was to examine relationships between submental adipose tissue thickness, pain sensitivity and gender with MAT and discomfort. Twenty-four healthy older adults participated in this study. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation was delivered to the submental region. Maximum amplitude tolerance and discomfort were measured for each condition. Furthermore, submental adipose tissue thickness and pain sensitivity were measured for each subject. Maximum amplitude tolerance was significantly increased for the TES protocols with short-pulse duration [F (3, 69) = 38.695, P {\textless} .0001]. Discomfort was similar across different TES protocols. Submental adipose tissue thickness (r = .30, P {\textless} .003) and pain sensitivity (r = −.43, P {\textless} .0001) were related to MAT. Pain sensitivity rating was also related to discomfort (r = .45, P {\textless} .0001). In conclusion, using TES protocols with short-pulse duration may increase the MAT. Higher amplitude stimulation may increase the impact on deep swallowing muscles. In addition, submental adipose tissue thickness and pain sensitivity are potential biopsychological factors that may affect MAT and discomfort.},

This paper introduces two methods of predicting axon activation that incorporate a threshold that includes the magnitude of the extracellular potential to achieve increased accuracy over previous computationally efficient methods. Each method uses a modified driving function that includes the second spatial difference of the applied extracellular voltage to predict the electrical excitation of a nerve. The first method uses the second spatial difference taken at a single node of Ranvier, while the second uses a weighted sum of the second spatial differences taken at all nodes of Ranvier. This study quantifies prediction accuracy for cases with single and multiple point source stimulating electrodes. While both new methods address the major criticism of linearized prediction models, the weighted sum method provides the most robust response across single and multiple point sources. These methods improve prediction of axon activation based on properties of the applied field in a computationally efficient manner.},

A simple analysis of a linear, "integrate to threshold" membrane model accounts for the threshold and latency differences observed experimentally and computationally. Since biphasic stimuli are used extensively in functional electrical stimulation, this analysis greatly simplifies the biophysical interpretation of responses to clinically relevant stimuli by relating them to the responses obtained with monophasic stimuli.},

Analytical solutions to Poisson's equation were used to calculate potentials in anisotropic infinite homogeneous media and isotropic semi-infinite inhomogeneous media, and the net driving function was used to calculate excitation thresholds for nerve fibers. The slope and intercept of the current-distance curve in anisotropic media were power functions of the ratio and product of the orthogonal conductivities, respectively. Excitation thresholds in anisotropic media were also dependent on the orientation of the fibers, and in strongly anisotropic media (/spl sigma//sub z///spl sigma//sub xy/{\textgreater}4) there were reversals in the recruitment order between different diameter fibers and between fibers at different distances from the electrode. In source-free regions of inhomogeneous media (two regions of differing conductivity separated by a plane boundary), the current-distance relationship of fibers parallel to the interface was dependent only on the average conductivity, whereas in regions containing the source the current-distance relationship was dependent on the individual values of conductivity. Reversals in recruitment order between fibers at different distances from the electrode and between fibers of differing diameter were found in inhomogeneous media. The results of this simulation study demonstrate that the electrical properties of the extracellular medium can have a strong influence on the pattern of neuronal excitation generated by extracellular electric fields, and indicate the importance of tissue electrical properties in interpreting results of studies employing electrical stimulation applied in complex biological volume conductors.},

Models of mammalian peripheral myelinated axons and experimental measurements on cat sciatic nerve were used to determine the effects of subthreshold polarization on neural excitability and recruitment. Subthreshold membrane depolarization generated a transient decrease in neural excitability and thus an increase in the threshold for stimulation by a subsequent stimulus pulse. The decrease in excitability increased as the duration and amplitude of the subthreshold depolarization were increased, and the increase in threshold was greater for fibers close to the electrode. When a depolarizing stimulus pulse was applied immediately after the subthreshold depolarization, nerve fibers far from the electrode could be stimulated without stimulating fibers close to the electrode. Subthreshold depolarizing prepulses inverted the current-distance relationship and allowed selective stimulation of nerve fibers far from the electrode.},

However, the effect of PNFS varies between patients; several stimulation parameters have not been investigated in depth, such as orientation of the nerve fiber in relation to the electrode. While placing the electrode parallel to the nerve fiber may give lower activation thresholds, anodal blocking may occur when the propagating action potential passes an anode. Methods A finite element model was used to simulate the extracellular potential during PNFS. This was combined with an active cable model of Aβ and Aδ nerve fibers. It was investigated how the angle between the nerve fiber and electrode affected the nerve activation and whether anodal blocking could occur. Finally, the area of paresthesia was estimated and compared with any concomitant Aδ fiber activation. Results The lowest threshold was found when nerve and electrode were in parallel, and that anodal blocking did not appear to occur during PNFS. The activation of Aβ fibers was within therapeutic range ({\textless}10V) of PNFS; however, within this range, Aδ fiber activation also may occur. The combined area of activated Aβ fibers (paresthesia) was at least two times larger than Aδ fibers for similar stimulation intensities. Conclusion No evidence of anodal blocking was observed in this PNFS model. The thresholds were lowest when the nerves and electrodes were parallel; thus, it may be relevant to investigate the overall position of the target nerve fibers prior to electrode placement.},

	abstract = {Carbonized rubber electrodes were tested extensively when they were first developed 30 years ago, but modern carbonized rubber electrodes have not received the type of scrutiny that the first electrodes received. Modern electrodes differ from the original electrodes in that they come with a self-adhesive electrode gel called hydrogel as part of their composition. The present study was undertaken to examine the current distribution and impedance characteristics of five brands of carbonized rubber electrodes and to examine the current distribution between electrodes during electrical stimulation in six subjects. Several different electrode sizes were tested between 3 and 10 cm. The current flow between the electrodes was determined by measuring the voltage across the skin on human subjects in 15 discrete locations between the electrodes. Blood flow was also measured between the electrodes with a laser Doppler flow meter to assess the physiological effect of current distribution on the skin at several skin temperatures. The results of these studies showed that at low currents, such as is used in TENS, very little current is actually applied through the skin due to the high impedance of the electrodes. At current levels normally used for electrical stimulation for functional movement, while current flow is better in most electrodes, it is very uneven, resulting in high current density in the centre of the electrodes and a fall off of at least 50\% in current intensity at the edges of the electrode. There was very little difference in current density between small and large electrodes due to the high current density in the centre. Skin blood flow altered the movement of current between the electrodes and also may contribute to electrode performance. The implication of these studies is that electrode design needs to be altered for better current distribution, especially at low stimulation currents.},

	abstract = {Background Peripheral nerve field stimulation (PNFS) is a potential treatment for chronic low-back pain. Pain relief using PNFS is dependent on activation of non-nociceptive Aβ-fibers. However, PNFS may also activate muscles, causing twitches and discomfort. In this study, we developed a mathematical model, to investigate the activation of sensory and motor nerves, as well as direct muscle fiber activation. Methods The extracellular field was estimated using a finite element model based on the geometry of CT scanned lumbar vertebrae. The electrode was modeled as being implanted to a depth of 10–15 mm. Three implant directions were modeled; horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. Both single electrode and “between-lead” stimulation between contralateral electrodes were modeled. The extracellular field was combined with models of sensory Aβ-nerves, motor neurons and muscle fibers to estimate their activation thresholds. Results The model showed that sensory Aβ fibers could be activated with thresholds down to 0.563 V, and the lowest threshold for motor nerve activation was 7.19 V using between-lead stimulation with the cathode located closest to the nerves. All thresholds for direct muscle activation were above 500 V. Conclusions The results suggest that direct muscle activation does not occur during PNFS, and concomitant motor and sensory nerve fiber activation are only likely to occur when using between-lead configuration. Thus, it may be relevant to investigate the location of the innervation zone of the low-back muscles prior to electrode implantation to avoid muscle activation.},

	abstract = {Myelin protein zero mutations were found to produce Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease phenotypes with various degrees of myelin impairment and axonal loss, ranging from the mild ‘demyelinating’ adult form to severe and early onset forms. Protein zero deficient homozygous mice () show a severe and progressive dysmyelinating neuropathy from birth with compromised myelin compaction, hypomyelination and distal axonal degeneration. A previous study using immunofluorescence showed that motor nerves deficient of myelin protein zero upregulate the NaV1.8 voltage gated sodium channel isoform, which is normally present only in restricted populations of sensory axons. The aim of this study was to investigate the function of motor axons in protein zero-deficient mice with particular emphasis on ectopic NaV1.8 voltage gated sodium channel. We combined ‘threshold tracking’ excitability studies with conventional nerve conduction studies, behavioural studies using rotor-rod measurements, and histological measures to assess membrane dysfunction and its progression in protein zero deficient homozygous mutants as compared with age-matched wild-type controls. The involvement of NaV1.8 was investigated by pharmacologic block using the subtype-selective NaV1.8 blocker A-803467 and chronically in NaV1.8 knock-outs. We found that in the context of dysmyelination, abnormal potassium ion currents and membrane depolarization, the ectopic NaV1.8 channels further impair the motor axon excitability in protein zero deficient homozygous mutants to an extent that precipitates conduction failure in severely affected axons. Our data suggest that a NaV1.8 channelopathy contributed to the poor motor function of protein zero deficient homozygous mutants, and that the conduction failure was associated with partially reversible reduction of the electrically evoked muscle response and of the clinical function as indicated by the partial recovery of function at rotor-rod measurements. As a consequence of these findings of partially reversible dysfunction, we propose that the NaV1.8 voltage gated sodium channel should be considered as a novel therapeutic target for Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease.},

	abstract = {Objective
Juvenile muscular atrophy of distal upper extremity (Hirayama disease) is characterized by juvenile-onset of asymmetric amyotrophy, but the pathophysiology has not been fully clarified. “Cold paresis”, aggravation of muscle weakness with exposure to cold, is a characteristic feature of this disease. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in axonal excitability properties in Hirayama disease.
Methods
Threshold tracking was used to measure strength-duration time constant (SDTC), threshold electrotonus, refractoriness, and supernormality in median motor axons at the wrist of 14 patients and 10 age-matched normal controls. The measurements were performed at room temperature and after cooling.
Results
Patients showed prolonged SDTC, fanning-out of threshold electrotonus curves, and increased refractoriness and supernormality. After cooling, there were similar changes in patients and normal subjects, compatible with axonal depolarization possibly due to paralysis of sodium–potassium pump.
Conclusions
Motor axonal excitability in Hirayama disease were characterized by increased persistent sodium currents, and dysfunction of transient sodium and potassium channels possibly associated with prominent collateral sprouting in young individuals. Further studies will be required to elucidate mechanisms for cold paresis.
Significance
Assessment of axonal excitability could provide characteristic features of ionic mechanisms in diseases with neurogenic amyotrophy such as Hirayama disease.},

	abstract = {Objective The aim of this study was to investigate whether axonal excitability indices are associated with survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Previous nerve excitability studies suggested increased persistent sodium currents in motor axons of patients with ALS, which lead to axonal hyperexcitability and potentially enhance neuronal death.
Methods 112 patients with sporadic ALS were followed up until endpoint (death or tracheostomy). Multivariate analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazard model. Threshold tracking was used to measure multiple axonal excitability indices in median motor axons, such as strength–duration time constant (SDTC; a measure of nodal persistent sodium current). Latent addition was also used to estimate the magnitude of persistent sodium currents.
Results The overall median tracheostomy-free survival from onset was 37 months. Prolonged SDTC was strongly associated with shorter survival (adjusted HR 4.07; 95\% CI 1.7 to 9.8; p=0.0018) compared with older onset age ({\textgreater}60 years; HR=1.80) and bulbar onset (HR=1.80). Estimated median survival was 34 months in the longer SDTC group and 51 months in the shorter SDTC group. This index was highly statistically significant even after multiple testing adjustments with age and site of onset (bulbar or limb). Latent addition study results were consistent with these findings.
Conclusions Axonal persistent sodium currents, estimated by SDTC and latent addition, are strong and independent predictors for shorter survival in patients with ALS. Membrane hyperexcitability is possibly associated with motor neuronal death, and modulation of excessive sodium currents could be a novel therapeutic option for ALS.},

	abstract = {Purpose: 
        Threshold tracking is a new noninvasive approach for detecting axonal excitability changes in vivo. In this study, the authors compared the excitability indices of motor and sensory axons of median and ulnar nerves to determine whether the two nerves behave in a similar or a noninterchangeable way. They also examined whether age affects these indices.
        Methods: 
        Seventy normal subjects aged 22–70 years (mean, 36.7 ± 12.5 years) were recruited. Multiple excitability indices were measured in both motor and sensory axons from median and ulnar nerves.
        Results: 
        The threshold and rheobase were significantly higher for the ulnar motor axons recorded at the first dorsal interosseous muscle than for the median motor axons at the abductor pollicis brevis muscle. In contrast, the strength-duration time constant was decreased, threshold electrotonus reduction (in both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing directions) was significantly smaller, I/V slope was decreased, and subexcitability was reduced for the ulnar motor axons. Excitability indices measured in the sensory axons of both nerves were not overtly different. In R-square analysis, age had a homogeneous influence on sensory axon excitability but heterogeneous influence on motor axon excitability.
        Conclusions: 
        The excitability indices may be interchangeable for sensory axons but not motor axons. The authors therefore recommend recording motor axonal excitability in various muscle groups rather than a single muscle group.},

We previously found that the inhibition of KCC3 cotransporter activity reduces the propagation of action potentials in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). However, the pathogenesis by which KCC3 deficiency impairs peripheral nerve function remains to be examined. Thus, we conducted imaging and electrophysiological studies in the peripheral nerves of KCC3−/− mice at various ages. Analysis using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed an age-dependent progressive swelling of microvilli and disorganization of paranodal loops in KCC3−/− nerves. Yet, no mislocated voltage-dependent channels were observed between the nodes and juxtaparanodes of KCC3−/− nerves. However, electrophysiological studies using the threshold tracking technique indicated a reduced stimulus–response curve slope with an elevated rheobase, a decreased strength–duration time constant, diminished persistent Na+ currents, and an outward deviation of threshold electrotonus in KCC3−/− nerves compared to wild-type nerves. These functional changes indicate an overall reduction in axonal excitability and suggest an increase in paranodal conductance, which was relevant to the pathology at the paranode. Altogether, our findings highlight the importance of KCC3 in maintaining paranodal integrity and in optimizing the propagation of action potentials along peripheral nerves.},

	abstract = {Background In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), muscle wasting preferentially affects the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and first dorsal interosseous over the abductor digit minimi (ADM), and this is termed ‘split hand’. Previous axonal excitability studies have suggested increased nodal persistent sodium current and reduced potassium current in motor axons in ALS, but the extent of excitability changes in APB and ADM axons in ALS has never been compared.
Objective To elucidate the peripheral axonal pathophysiology of split hand.
Methods In both APB and ADM motor axons of 21 patients with ALS and 17 age-matched normal controls, threshold tracking was used to measure excitability indices such as strength-duration time constant (SDTC; a measure of persistent sodium current) and threshold electrotonus.
Results In normal controls, SDTC was significantly longer for APB than ADM axons, suggesting that axonal excitability is physiologically higher in APB axons. Compared with normal controls, patients with ALS had longer SDTC and greater threshold changes in depolarising threshold electrotonus in both APB and ADM axons. Furthermore, the difference in extent of SDTC prolongation between normal subjects and patients with ALS was greater in APB than ADM axons.
Conclusions APB axons have physiologically higher excitability than ADM axons, and, in ALS, the hyperexcitability is more prominent in APB axons. Although cortical mechanisms would also be involved, more prominent hyperexcitability of APB axons may contribute to development of split hand, and the altered axonal properties are possibly associated with motor neuronal death in ALS.},

	abstract = {Key points We tested the recovery of motor axon conduction and multiple measures of excitability by ‘threshold-tracking’ after ultrasound-guided distal median nerve regional anaesthesia by lidocaine. Lidocaine caused a transient conduction failure that recovered completely by 3 h, whereas excitability recovered only partially by 6 h and fully by 24 h. The up to 7-fold increase in threshold after complete recovery of conduction was associated with excitability changes that could only partially be explained by block of the voltage-gated Na+ channel (VGSC). Mathematical modelling indicated that, apart from a reduction in the number of functioning VGSCs, lidocaine also caused a decrease of passive membrane resistance and an increase of capacitance. Our data suggest that lidocaine, even at clinical ‘sub-blocking’ concentrations, could cause a reversible structural impairment of the axolemma. Abstract The local anaesthetic lidocaine is known to block voltage-gated Na+ channels (VGSCs), although at high concentration it was also reported to block other ion channel currents as well as to alter lipid membranes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the clinical regional anaesthetic action of lidocaine could be accounted for solely by the block of VGSCs or whether other mechanisms are also relevant. We tested the recovery of motor axon conduction and multiple measures of excitability by ‘threshold-tracking’ after ultrasound-guided distal median nerve regional anaesthesia in 13 healthy volunteers. Lidocaine caused rapid complete motor axon conduction block localized at the wrist. Within 3 h, the force of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle and median motor nerve conduction studies returned to normal. In contrast, the excitability of the motor axons at the wrist remained markedly impaired as indicated by a 7-fold shift of the stimulus–response curves to higher currents with partial recovery by 6 h and full recovery by 24 h. The strength–duration properties were abnormal with markedly increased rheobase and reduced strength–duration time constant. The changes in threshold during electrotonus, especially during depolarization, were markedly reduced. The recovery cycle showed increased refractoriness and reduced superexcitability. The excitability changes were only partly similar to those previously observed after poisoning with the VGSC blocker tetrodotoxin. Assuming an unaltered ion-channel gating, modelling indicated that, apart from up to a 4-fold reduction in the number of functioning VGSCs, lidocaine also caused a decrease of passive membrane resistance and an increase of capacitance. Our data suggest that the lidocaine effects, even at clinical ‘sub-blocking’ concentrations, could reflect, at least in part, a reversible structural impairment of the axolemma.},

	abstract = {Background Upregulation of persistent Na+ conductances has been linked to axonal degeneration in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and has also been reported in the transgenic superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1) mouse model. The mechanisms of ectopic activity (fasciculations and cramp) and axonal degeneration still require clarification in familial ALS (FALS) in humans, and specifically whether there are any differences to the processes identified in sporadic patients. Consequently, novel threshold tracking techniques were used to assess whether upregulation of persistent Na+ conductances was a feature linked to axonal degeneration in FALS.
Methods Axonal excitability studies were undertaken in six FALS patients, 13 asymptomatic SOD-1 mutation carriers and 45 sporadic ALS (SALS) patients.
Results Compound muscle action potential amplitude was significantly reduced in FALS (6.3±1.3 mV) and SALS (6.0±0.4 mV) compared with controls (10.0±0.4 mV, p{\textless}0.05). The mean strength duration time constant (τSD) was significantly increased in FALS (0.55±0.10 ms, p{\textless}0.05) and SALS (0.52±0.02 ms, p{\textless}0.01) compared with controls (0.41±0.02). There were no differences in τSD between asymptomatic SOD-1 mutation carriers and controls. The increase in τSD correlated with the CMAP amplitude (r=−0.4) and neurophysiological index (r=−0.4). In separate studies that assessed cortical processes, short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) was significantly reduced (FALS, −2.7±1.3\%; controls 13.7±1.3\%, p{\textless}0.0001) and intracortical facilitation increased (FALS, −5.0±2.2\%; controls −0.4±1.1\%, p{\textless}0.05) in FALS. The reduction in SICI correlated with τSD (r=−0.8).
Conclusions Taken together, these studies suggest that persistent Na+ conductances are upregulated in FALS and that this upregulation is intrinsically associated with axonal degeneration.},

	abstract = {Key points Restless legs patients complain about sensory and motor symptoms leading to sleep disturbances. Symptoms include painful sensations, an urge to move and involuntary leg movements. The responsible mechanisms of restless legs syndrome are still not known, although current studies indicate an increased neuronal network excitability. Reflex studies indicate the involvement of spinal structures. Peripheral mechanisms have not been investigated so far. In the present study, we provide evidence of increased hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel-mediated inward rectification in motor axons. The excitability of sensory axons was not changed. We conclude that, in restless legs syndrome, an increased HCN current in motoneurons may play a pathophysiological role, such that these channels could represent a valuable target for pharmaceutical intervention. Abstract Restless legs syndrome is a sensorimotor network disorder. So far, the responsible pathophysiological mechanisms are poorly understood. In the present study, we provide evidence that the excitability of peripheral motoneurons contributes to the pathophysiology of restless legs syndrome. In vivo excitability studies on motor and sensory axons of the median nerve were performed on patients with idiopathic restless legs syndrome (iRLS) who were not currently on treatment. The iRLS patients had greater accommodation in motor but not sensory axons to long-lasting hyperpolarization compared to age-matched healthy subjects, indicating greater inward rectification in iRLS. The most reasonable explanation is that hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels open at less hyperpolarized membrane potentials, a view supported by mathematical modelling. The half-activation potential for HCN channels (Bq) was the single best parameter that accounted for the difference between normal controls and iRLS data. A 6 mV depolarization of Bq reduced the discrepancy between the normal control model and the iRLS data by 92.1\%. Taken together, our results suggest an increase in the excitability of motor units in iRLS that could enhance the likelihood of leg movements. The abnormal axonal properties are consistent with other findings indicating that the peripheral system is part of the network involved in iRLS.},

	abstract = {The repetitive discharges required to produce a sustained muscle contraction results in activity-dependent hyperpolarization of the motor axons and a reduction in the force-generating capacity of the muscle. We investigated the relationship between these changes in the adductor pollicis muscle and the motor axons of its ulnar nerve supply, and the reproducibility of these changes. Ten subjects performed a 1-min maximal voluntary contraction. Activity-dependent changes in axonal excitability were measured using threshold tracking with electrical stimulation at the wrist; changes in the muscle were assessed as evoked and voluntary electromyography (EMG) and isometric force. Separate components of axonal excitability and muscle properties were tested at 5 min intervals after the sustained contraction in 5 separate sessions. The current threshold required to produce the target muscle action potential increased immediately after the contraction by 14.8\% (p{\textless}0.05), reflecting decreased axonal excitability secondary to hyperpolarization. This was not correlated with the decline in amplitude of muscle force or evoked EMG. A late reversal in threshold current after the initial recovery from hyperpolarization peaked at −5.9\% at ∼35 min (p{\textless}0.05). This pattern was mirrored by other indices of axonal excitability revealing a previously unreported depolarization of motor axons in the late recovery period. Measures of axonal excitability were relatively stable at rest but less so after sustained activity. The coefficient of variation (CoV) for threshold current increase was higher after activity (CoV 0.54, p{\textless}0.05) whereas changes in voluntary (CoV 0.12) and evoked twitch (CoV 0.15) force were relatively stable. These results demonstrate that activity-dependent changes in motor axon excitability are unlikely to contribute to concomitant changes in the muscle after sustained activity in healthy people. The variability in axonal excitability after sustained activity suggests that care is needed when using these measures if the integrity of either the muscle or nerve may be compromised.},

Consequently, this study aimed to determine whether differences in excitability follow a split-hand pattern across the intrinsic hand muscles. Methods: Excitability studies were undertaken using threshold tracking techniques in 26 healthy controls with responses recorded over APB, FDI, and abductor digiti minimi. Results: Short interval intracortical inhibition was significantly greater from the APB and FDI. In addition, motor evoked potential amplitude was greater, while cortical silent period was longer from APB and FDI. At a peripheral level, the strength-duration time constant was greater when recorded over APB. Conclusions: This study establishes that differences in cortical excitability follow the split-hand pattern in healthy controls, a finding potentially explained by evolution of specialized activity of APB/FDI in complex hand tasks.

The aim of the study was to investigate the long-term progression of motor dysfunction in P0+/− mice at 3, 7, 12 and 20months. By comparison with WT littermates, P0+/− showed a decreasing motor performance with age. This was associated with a progressive reduction in amplitude and increase in latency of the plantar compound muscle action potential (CMAP) evoked by stimulation of the tibial nerve at ankle. This progressive functional impairment was in contrast to the mild demyelinating neuropathy of the tibial nerve revealed by histology. “Threshold-tracking” studies showed impaired motor axon excitability in P0+/− from 3months. With time, there was a progressive reduction in threshold deviations during both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing threshold electrotonus associated with increasing resting I/V slope and increasing strength-duration time constant. These depolarizing features in excitability in P0+/− as well as the reduced CMAP amplitude were absent in P0+/− NaV1.8 knockouts, and could be acutely reversed by selective pharmacologic block of NaV1.8 in P0+/−. Mathematical modeling indicated an association of altered passive cable properties with a depolarizing shift in resting membrane potential and increase in the persistent Na+ current in P0+/−. Our data suggest that ectopic NaV1.8 expression precipitates depolarizing conduction failure in CMT1B, and that motor axon dysfunction in demyelinating neuropathy is pharmacologically reversible.},

We compared tibial nerve conduction and excitability measures by threshold tracking in 12 months (mature) and 20 months (aged) wild-type (WT) mice. With aging, deviations during threshold electrotonus were attenuated and the resting current-threshold slope and early refractoriness were increased.

An increased Nav1.8 isoform expression was found by immunohistochemistry. The depolarizing excitability features were absent in Nav1.8 null mice, and they were counteracted in WT mice by a Nav1.8 blocker.

We evaluated the differences in the motor axonal excitability properties of 16 cases of sensorimotor Guillain-Barré syndrome by nerve excitability testing (NET). The antiganglioside antibody assay and follow-up NCS resulted in 12 patients diagnosed as AIDP and 4 patients as AMSAN. Clinical and excitability parameters in each group were compared with those in 30 normal controls. Automated NET with threshold tracking techniques was used to calculate the strength–duration time constant (SDTC), threshold electrotonus (TE), current–threshold relationship (CTR), and recovery cycle (RC) of excitability. Except for subtle changes in excitability parameters, AIDP showed no definitive difference relative to normal controls. Comparison between AMSAN and normal controls also revealed no significant differences in the SDTC, TE, and CTR parameters. However, there were clear differences in some of the RC parameters: the relative refractory period was significantly longer in the AMSAN group than in the AIDP group (4.40 ± 1.11 vs. 3.09 ± 1.01 ms, mean ± SEM; p {\textless} 0.001), while superexcitability was significantly less prominent in the AMSAN group (−6.80 ± 10.30 vs. −26.48 ± 1.17\%, mean ± SEM; p {\textless} 0.001). Our study identified that both AIDP and AMSAN were associated with subtle changes in excitability properties.

Computer-assisted threshold tracking in humans has helped to define clinically relevant changes of nerve excitability in response to hyperventilation and ischaemia, but in vivo studies cannot directly differentiate between the impact of pH and other secondary factors. In this investigation, we applied an excitability testing protocol to a rat saphenous skin nerve in vitro preparation. Changes in extracellular pH were induced by altering pCO2 in the perfusate, and excitability properties of large myelinated fibres were measured in the pH range from 6.9 to 8.1. The main effect of protons on nerve excitability was a near linear increase in threshold which was accompanied by a decrease in strength-duration time constant reflecting mainly a decrease in persistent sodium current. In the recovery cycle, late subexcitability following 7 conditioning stimuli was substantially reduced at acid pH, indicating a block of slow but not of fast potassium channels. Changes in threshold electrotonus were complex, reflecting the combined effects of pH on multiple channel types. These results provide the first systematic data on pH sensitivity of mammalian nerve excitability properties, and may help in the interpretation of abnormal clinical excitability measurements.},

	abstract = {Episodic ataxia type 1 is a neuronal channelopathy caused by mutations in the KCNA1 gene encoding the fast K+ channel subunit Kv1.1. Episodic ataxia type 1 presents with brief episodes of cerebellar dysfunction and persistent neuromyotonia and is associated with an increased incidence of epilepsy. In myelinated peripheral nerve, Kv1.1 is highly expressed in the juxtaparanodal axon, where potassium channels limit the depolarizing afterpotential and the effects of depolarizing currents. Axonal excitability studies were performed on patients with genetically confirmed episodic ataxia type 1 to characterize the effects of Kv1.1 dysfunction on motor axons in vivo. The median nerve was stimulated at the wrist and compound muscle action potentials were recorded from abductor pollicis brevis. Threshold tracking techniques were used to record strength-duration time constant, threshold electrotonus, current/threshold relationship and the recovery cycle. Recordings from 20 patients from eight kindreds with different KCNA1 point mutations were compared with those from 30 normal controls. All 20 patients had a history of episodic ataxia and 19 had neuromyotonia. All patients had similar, distinctive abnormalities: superexcitability was on average 100\% higher in the patients than in controls (P {\textless} 0.00001) and, in threshold electrotonus, the increase in excitability due to a depolarizing current (20\% of threshold) was 31\% higher (P {\textless} 0.00001). Using these two parameters, the patients with episodic ataxia type 1 and controls could be clearly separated into two non-overlapping groups. Differences between the different KCNA1 mutations were not statistically significant. Studies of nerve excitability can identify Kv1.1 dysfunction in patients with episodic ataxia type 1. The simple 15 min test may be useful in diagnosis, since it can differentiate patients with episodic ataxia type 1 from normal controls with high sensitivity and specificity.},

	abstract = {Objective
Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor with high efficacy for multiple myeloma but with severe peripheral neurotoxicity, leading to dose modification and severe neurological disability. This study aimed to investigate the pathophysiology of bortezomib-induced neuropathy.
Methods
Threshold tracking was used to assess the excitability of sensory and motor axons. Measurements were sequentially performed before and after bortezomib treatment in nine patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
Results
In total, 67\% of patients finally developed symptomatic neuropathy. Changes in sensory axonal excitability indices readily occurred after the first course of administration. Patterns of changes in excitability indices suggest membrane depolarization (decreased superexcitability, P{\textless}0.001; decreased depolarizing threshold electrotonus 90–100ms, P=0.02). Abnormalities in nerve conduction parameters suggestive of axonal degeneration appeared after the second course of treatment.
Conclusions
Bortezomib induces a depolarizing shift in resting membrane potential prior to the development of neuropathy. Membrane depolarization could be associated with impairment of electrogenic Na+–K+-ATPase-dependent pump caused by toxic effects of bortezomib on mitochondria.
Significance
Axonal depolarization and hyperexcitability might enhance neurodegeneration in bortezomib-induced neuropathy.},

	abstract = {Motor nerve excitability studies by “threshold tracking” in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) revealed heterogeneous abnormalities in motor axon membrane function possibly depending on disease stage. It remains unclear to which extent the excitability deviations reflect a pathogenic mechanism in ALS or are merely a consequence of axonal degeneration. We investigated motor axon excitability in presymptomatic and symptomatic SOD1G127X mutants, a mouse model of ALS with late clinical onset and rapid disease progression. After clinical onset, there was a rapid loss of functional motor units associated with an increase in rheobase and strength–duration time constant, an increase in refractoriness at the expense of the superexcitability, larger than normal threshold deviations during both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing threshold electrotonus with impaired accommodation and reduction of the input conductance. These abnormalities progressed rapidly over a few days and were associated with morphological evidence of ongoing axonal degeneration. Presymptomatic mice with unaltered motor performance at rotor-rod measurement also had an increase in refractoriness at the expense of the superexcitability during the recovery cycle. This was, however, associated with smaller than normal deviations during threshold electrotonus, and a steeper resting current–threshold slope indicating slight axonal depolarization in agreement with motoneuronal hyperexcitability indicated by enhanced F-waves. Our data suggest that SOD1G127X motor axons undergo a state of membrane depolarization; however, during rapid motoneuron loss disease-specific nerve excitability measures are confounded by excitability changes in degenerating but still conducting axons. These findings should be considered in the interpretation of disease-stage-related nerve excitability changes in ALS.},

An insufficiently short PNB duration following single-shot LA can be optimized by development of extended release formulations among which liposomes have been shown to be the least toxic. In vivo rodent models for PNB have focused primarily on assessing behavioral responses following LA. In a previous study in human volunteers, we found that it is feasible to monitor the effect of LA in vivo by combining conventional conduction studies with nerve excitability studies. Here, we aimed to develop a mouse model where the same neurophysiological techniques can be used to investigate liposomal formulations of LA in vivo. To challenge the validity of the model, we tested the motor PNB following an unilamellar liposomal formulation, filled with the intermediate-duration LA lidocaine. Experiments were carried out in adult transgenic mice with fluorescent axons and with fluorescent tagged liposomes to allow in vivo imaging by probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy. Recovery of conduction following LA injection at the ankle was monitored by stimulation of the tibial nerve fibers at the sciatic notch and recording of the plantar compound motor action potential (CMAP). We detected a delayed recovery in CMAP amplitude following liposomal lidocaine, without detrimental systemic effects. Furthermore, CMAP threshold-tracking studies of the distal tibial nerve showed that the increased rheobase was associated with a sequence of excitability changes similar to those found following non-encapsulated lidocaine PNB in humans, further supporting the translational value of the model.},

	abstract = {Population-based studies including systematic echocardiographic examinations are required to assess the prevalence of valvular heart disease. In industrialized countries, the prevalence of valvular heart disease is estimated at 2.5\%. Because of the predominance of degenerative etiologies, the prevalence of valvular disease increases markedly after the age of 65 years, in particular with regard to aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation, which accounts for 3 in 4 cases of valvular disease. Rheumatic heart disease still represents 22\% of valvular heart disease in Europe. The prevalence of secondary mitral regurgitation cannot be assessed reliably but it seems to be a frequent disease. The incidence of infective endocarditis is approximately 30 cases per million individiuals per year. Its stability is associated with marked changes in its presentation. Patients are getting older and staphylococcus is now becoming the microorganism most frequently responsible. Heath care-associated infections are the most likely explanation of changes in the microbiology of infective endocarditis. In developing countries, rheumatic heart disease remains the leading cause of valvular heart disease. Its prevalence is high, between 20 and 30 cases per 1000 subjects when using systematic echocardiographic screening. In conclusion, the temporal and geographical heterogeneity illustrates the effect of socioeconomic status and changes in life expectancy on the frequency and presentation of valvular heart disease. A decreased burden of valvular disease would require the elaboration of preventive strategies in industrialized countries and an improvement in the socioeconomic environment in developing countries.
Les études basées sur une population, dont les examens échocardiographiques systématiques, sont nécessaires pour évaluer la prévalence de la cardiopathie valvulaire. Dans les pays industrialisés, la prévalence de la cardiopathie valvulaire est estimée à 2,5 \%. En raison de la prédominance d’étiologies dégénératives, la prévalence de la valvulopathie augmente de façon marquée après l’âge de 65 ans, en particulier celle de la sténose aortique et de la régurgitation mitrale, qui compte 3 cas de valvulopathie sur 4. La cardiopathie rhumatismale représente encore 22 \% des cardiopathies valvulaires en Europe. La prévalence de la régurgitation mitrale secondaire ne peut pas être évaluée de manière fiable, mais elle semble être une maladie fréquente. L’incidence de l’endocardite infectieuse est approximativement de 30 cas par million d’individus par année. Sa stabilité est associée à des changements marqués de son tableau clinique. Les patients deviennent plus âgés et le staphylococcus est maintenant le microorganisme le plus fréquemment responsable. Les infections associées aux soins constituent l’explication la plus probable des changements microbiologiques de l’endocardite infectieuse. Dans les pays en voie de développement, la cardiopathie rhumatismale demeure la cause principale de la cardiopathie valvulaire. Sa prévalence est élevée, soit entre 20 et 30 cas par 1000 sujets lors de dépistages échocardiographiques systématiques. En conclusion, l’hétérogénéité temporelle et géographique illustre les effets du statut socioéconomique et de l’évolution de l’espérance de vie sur la fréquence et le tableau clinique de la cardiopathie valvulaire.

	abstract = {Many disorders, including common cardiac conditions, are linked to increased risk from thrombosis and require anticoagulant therapy. Oral anticoagulation control (AC) is used to reduce the chance of unwanted thrombosis. AC therapy lengthens the time it takes for a sample of a patient's blood to clot. Such therapy, usually with warfarin, requires frequent monitoring to maintain a beneficial balance between decreased clotting and the tendency for increased bleeding that results from therapy. Conventional monitoring has involved patients attending clinic for measurement of clotting speed. A physician then adjusts the patient's anticoagulant dose to achieve the desired balance between reduced clotting and tendency to bleed. Two other anticoagulation management strategies have been developed that employ near-patient testing (NPT) devices. With these devices, patients can measure clotting speed themselves ('patient self-testing'); a physician uses the result to adjust the patient's anticoagulant dose or the patients adjust the dose of anticoagulant themselves in the light of their own measurements with the NPT device ['patient self-management' (PSM)]. These two strategies are collectively referred to as patient self-monitoring.},

	abstract = {Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) is a rapidly expanding indication for lifelong oral anticoagulation. The vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) effectively prevent stroke, but are notoriously difficult to manage and are associated with frequent adverse events. These factors account for the widespread underuse of warfarin for patients with AF who are qualified candidates for therapy. New oral anticoagulants with different mechanisms of action are beginning to exit phase III trials and may replace the VKAs for a number of indications, especially AF. The oral direct thrombin and Xa inhibitors are furthest along in development. Dabigatran etexilate, a thrombin inhibitor, has recently shown excellent outcomes in the prevention of stroke in patients with AF. The oral Xa inhibitors are still in phase III trials for stroke prevention in AF, but results from trials for other indications look promising. These short-acting, short-duration, unmonitored drugs are not without limitations and potential adverse effects. The perceived drawbacks of the VKAs may actually be assets in the management of patients with AF, and the pros and cons of each class of drug must be taken into account as physicians consider or patients request transition to a new class of oral anticoagulants.},

	abstract = {Purpose

A growing number of patients today receive anticoagulants. These drugs can cause serious adverse reactions leading to patients' hospitalization. The present study aimed to assess the number of hospital admissions as a result of anticoagulant adverse reactions in Alsace, a French region of 1.8 million inhabitants, and to estimate the economic burden associated with their management.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was performed using data extracted from the regional and anonymous hospital Programme de Médicalisation des Systèmes d'Information (PMSI) database to assess the number of hospital admissions and the associated costs. Stays from public and private hospitals were extracted from the database using two International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, codes referring to anticoagulant drugs: ‘T45.5—Poisoning by anticoagulants’ and ‘Y44.2—Anticoagulants' adverse effect in therapeutic use’. Costs were calculated from official French tariffs.

Results

Within a 2-year period from 1 Januray 2010 to 31 December 2011, 462 anticoagulant-related hospital admissions, predominantly in elderly patients, were identified in Alsace. These stays, as a result of anticoagulant adverse reactions, represented a cost of 2 050 127.86 euros (including hospitalization and expensive drugs).

Conclusion

Regional PMSI database constitutes an effective tool to explore anticoagulant-related hospital admissions. Based on our study, one can state that the cost of anticoagulation therapies lies not only in the price of the drugs but also in the cost of adverse reaction management. Policy makers should be aware of this reality and should focus on better medication supervision in order to improve patient safety and reduce expenses. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Aims Since atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with increased risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications, estimations on the number of individuals with AF are relevant to healthcare planning. We aimed to project the number of individuals with AF in the Netherlands and in the European Union from 2000 to 2060. Methods and results Age- and sex-specific AF prevalence estimates were obtained from the prospective community-based Rotterdam Study. Population projections for the Netherlands and the European Union were obtained from the European Union's statistics office. In the age stratum of 55–59 years, the prevalence of AF was 1.3\% in men (95\% CI: 0.4–3.6\%) and 1.7\% in women (95\% CI: 0.7–4.0\%). The prevalence of AF increased to 24.2\% in men (95\% CI: 18.5–30.7\%), and 16.1\% in women (95\% CI: 13.1–19.4\%), for those {\textgreater}85 years of age. This age- and sex-specific prevalence remained stable during the years of follow-up. Furthermore, we estimate that in the European Union, 8.8 million adults over 55 years had AF in 2010 (95\% CI: 6.5–12.3 million). We project that this number will double by 2060 to 17.9 million (95\% CI: 13.6–23.7 million) if the age- and sex-specific prevalence remains stable. Conclusion We estimate that from 2010 to 2060, the number of adults 55 years and over with AF in the European Union will more than double. As AF is associated with significant morbidities and mortality, this increasing number of individuals with AF may have major public health implications.},

	abstract = {Estimates and projections of diagnosed incidence and prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in the United States have been highly inconsistent across published studies. Although it is generally acknowledged that AF incidence and prevalence are increasing due to growing numbers of older people in the U.S. population, estimates of the rate of expected growth have varied widely. Reasons for these variations include differences in study design, covered time period, birth cohort, and temporal effects, as well as improvements in AF diagnosis due to increased use of diagnostic tools and health care awareness. The objective of this study was to estimate and project the incidence and prevalence of diagnosed AF in the United States out to 2030. A large health insurance claims database for the years 2001 to 2008, representing a geographically diverse 5\% of the U.S. population, was used in this study. The trend and growth rate in AF incidence and prevalence was projected by a dynamic age-period cohort simulation progression model that included all diagnosed AF cases in future prevalence projections regardless of follow-up treatment, as well as those cases expected to be chronic in nature. Results from the model showed that AF incidence will double, from 1.2 million cases in 2010 to 2.6 million cases in 2030. Given this increase in incidence, AF prevalence is projected to increase from 5.2 million in 2010 to 12.1 million cases in 2030. The effect of uncertainty in model parameters was explored in deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Variability in future trends in AF incidence and recurrence rates has the greatest impact on the projected estimates of chronic AF prevalence. It can be concluded that both incidence and prevalence of AF are likely to rise from 2010 to 2030, but there exists a wide range of uncertainty around the magnitude of future trends.},

	abstract = {Despite limited scientific knowledge, stretching of human skeletal muscle to improve flexibility is a widespread practice among althletes. This article reviews recent findings regarding passive properties of the hamstring muscle group during stretch based on a model that was developed which could synchronously and continuously measure passive hamstring resistance and electromyographic activity, while the velocity and angle of stretch was controlled. Resistance to stretch was defined as passive torque (Nm) offered by the hamstring muscle group during passive knee extension using an isokinetic dynamometer with a modified thigh pad. To simulate a clinical static stretch, the knee was passively extended to a pre-determined final position (0.0875 rad/s, dynamic phase) where it remained stationary for 90s (static phase). Alternatively, the knee was extended to the point of discomfort (stretch tolerance). From the torque-angle curve of the dynamic phase of the static stretch, and in the stretch tolerance protocol, passive energy and stiffness were calculated. Torque decline in the static phase was considered to represent viscoelastis stress relaxation. Using the model, studies were conducted which demonstrated that a single static stretch resulted in a 30\% viscoelastic stress relaxation. With repeated stretches muscle stiffness declined, but returned to baseline values within 1 h. Long-term stretching (3 weeks) increased joint range of motion as a result of a change in stretch tolerance rather than in the passive properties. Strength training resulted in increased muscle stiffness, which was unaffected by daily stretching. The effectiveness of different stretching tecniques was attributed to a change in strech tolerance rather than passive properties. Inflexible and older subjects have increased muscle stiffness, but a lower stretch tolerance compared to subjects with normal flexiblity and younger subjects, respectively. Although far from all questions regarding the passive properties of humans skeletal muscle have been answered in these studies, the measurement technique permited skeletal muscle.},

	abstract = {The time-varying stiffness dynamics of the human ankle joint were identified during a large stretch imposed upon the active triceps surae muscles. Small stochastic position perturbations were superimposed upon many repetitions of the larger movement and an ensemble time-varying identification technique was then used to characterize the relationship between the small perturbation and the torque it evoked at each sample in time throughout the movement. This technique was found to provide an excellent description of the ankle stiffness dynamics throughout this movement, with the identified stiffness impulse response functions accounting for more than 80\% of the torque variance at all times. The average low-frequency stiffness values (K low) derived from the stiffness impulse responses at each sample in time are believed to reflect primarily the instantaneous elastic properties of active crossbridges. These properties, which reflect the contractile state of the muscles more directly than force or torque measurements, have not been obtained previously from an intact muscle-joint system. We found that stiffness actually increased during the later portion of the large imposed stretch, indicating the triceps surae muscles did not yield significantly, and that the post-stretch steady-state stiffness level was approximately 60\% higher than prior to the stretch. Reflex activity evoked by the large stretch did not produce a detectable change in K low, even though this activity did produce a clear twitch-like response in joint torque beginning approximately 60 ms following stretch onset. A second-order mechanical model was found to provide an adequate characterization of stiffness dynamics for steady-state periods before and well after the imposed movement, but it could not adequately describe the observed changes in stiffness dynamics during the movement itself. However, the variation of model parameters indicated that the torque evoked by the stochastic displacement was predominantly elastic in nature. The stiffness behavior during stretch observed here for the intact human ankle joint is largely consistent with previous studies performed in isolated muscle preparations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Spasticity is a common complication with neurological diseases and CNS lesions. Instrumented systems to evaluate spasticity often cannot provide an immediate result, thus limiting their clinical usefulness. In this study we investigated the accuracy and reliability of the portable Neurokinetics RA1 Ridgidity Analyzer to measure stiffness of the ankle joint in 46 controls, 14 spinal cord injured (SCI) and 23 multiple sclerosis (MS) participants.
METHODS: Ankle stiffness measures were made twice by two raters, at speeds above and below the expected stretch reflex threshold. Ankle torque was measured with the portable device and a stationary torque motor. Inter- and intra-rater reliability was assessed with the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC).
RESULTS: Stiffness measures with the portable and stationary devices were significantly correlated for controls and MS participants (p {\textless} 0.01). Intra-rater reliability for the portable device ranged from 0.60-0.89 (SCI) and 0.63-0.67 (control) and inter-rater reliability ranged from 0.70-0.73 (SCI) and 0.61-0.77 (control). Ankle stiffness measures in SCI and MS participants were significantly larger than in controls for both slow (p {\textless} 0.05) and fast movements (p {\textless} 0.01), with stiffness being larger for fast compared to slow movements in SCI and MS participants (p {\textless} 0.05), but not in controls (p = 0.5).
CONCLUSION: The portable device correlated well with measures obtained by a torque motor in both controls and MS participants, showed high intra- and inter-rater reliability for the SCI participants, and could easily distinguish between stiff and control ankle joints. However, the device, in its current form, may be less accurate during rapid movements when inertia contributes to stiffness and the shape of the air-filled pads did not provide a good interface with the foot.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that a portable device can potentially be a useful diagnostic tool to obtain reliable information of stiffness for the ankle joint.},

	abstract = {Summary form only given. Strong light-matter coupling has been recently successfully explored in the GHz and THz [1] range with on-chip platforms. New and intriguing quantum optical phenomena have been predicted in the ultrastrong coupling regime [2], when the coupling strength Ω becomes comparable to the unperturbed frequency of the system ω. We recently proposed a new experimental platform where we couple the inter-Landau level transition of an high-mobility 2DEG to the highly subwavelength photonic mode of an LC meta-atom [3] showing very large Ω/ωc = 0.87. Our system benefits from the collective enhancement of the light-matter coupling which comes from the scaling of the coupling Ω ∝ √n, were n is the number of optically active electrons. In our previous experiments [3] and in literature [4] this number varies from 104-103 electrons per meta-atom. We now engineer a new cavity, resonant at 290 GHz, with an extremely reduced effective mode surface Seff = 4 × 10-14 m2 (FE simulations, CST), yielding large field enhancements above 1500 and allowing to enter the few ({\textless};100) electron regime. It consist of a complementary metasurface with two very sharp metallic tips separated by a 60 nm gap (Fig.1(a, b)) on top of a single triangular quantum well. THz-TDS transmission experiments as a function of the applied magnetic field reveal strong anticrossing of the cavity mode with linear cyclotron dispersion. Measurements for arrays of only 12 cavities are reported in Fig.1(c). On the top horizontal axis we report the number of electrons occupying the topmost Landau level as a function of the magnetic field. At the anticrossing field of B=0.73 T we measure approximately 60 electrons ultra strongly coupled (Ω/ω- {\textbar}{\textbar}},

	abstract = {Objectives: To investigate the effect of frequency of alternating current on the sensory, motor, and pain thresholds in normal subjects, and to establish the optimal frequency for motor stimulation with minimal subject discomfort. Design: A repeated measures design using two groups of 11 subjects. Setting: A laboratory setting was used. Participants: Participants were volunteers who met the inclusion criteria. Interventions: Alternating current with 20 different carrier frequencies between 1 and 35kHz, all modulated at 50Hz, was applied to each subject on two separate occasions. For half the subjects, the frequency was increased or decreased sequentially (reversed on second occasion), and for the other half, it was applied in a different random order on each occasion. Main Outcome Measures: The voltage at the sensory threshold was recorded for each applied frequency. This was subsequently repeated for motor and pain thresholds. Results: Sensory, motor, and pain thresholds decreased with increasing frequency between 1kHz and approximately 10kHz. Above 10kHz, the thresholds increased. The ratio pain threshold/sensory threshold increased systematically with increasing frequency over the range examined. By contrast, the ratio pain threshold/motor threshold showed a distinct maximum at a frequency of 10kHz. Marked accommodation to motor and pain fiber stimulation was observed. Conclusions: For comfortable sensory stimulation, a high frequency of alternating current is preferable. Discrimination between pain and motor stimulation is maximal at a frequency of approximately 10kHz. This suggests that the optimal frequency for comfortable motor stimulation, one that is least likely to elicit pain fiber stimulation, is close to 10kHz.},

	abstract = {Transcutaneous electrical stimulation can depolarize nerve or muscle cells applying impulses through electrodes attached on the skin. For these applications, the electrode-skin impedance is an important factor which influences effectiveness. Various models describe the interface using constant or current-depending resistive-capacitive equivalent circuit. Here, we develop a dynamic impedance model valid for a wide range stimulation intensities. The model considers electroporation and charge-dependent effects to describe the impedance variation, which allows to describe high-charge pulses. The parameters were adjusted based on rectangular, biphasic stimulation pulses generated by a stimulator, providing optionally current or voltage-controlled impulses, and applied through electrodes of different sizes. Both control methods deliver a different electrical field to the tissue, which is constant throughout the impulse duration for current-controlled mode or have a very current peak for voltage-controlled. The results show a predominant dependence in the current intensity in the case of both stimulation techniques that allows to keep a simple model. A verification simulation using the proposed dynamic model shows coefficient of determination of around 0.99 in both stimulation types. The presented method for fitting electrode-skin impedance can be simple extended to other stimulation waveforms and electrode configuration. Therefore, it can be embedded in optimization algorithms for designing electrical stimulation applications even for pulses with high charges and high current spikes.},

Objectives: To evaluate the effect of the semiconditional electrical stimulation on dorsal penile nerve (DPN) to improve the complicated bladder function in male with spinal cord injury (SCI).
Setting: Semiconditional stimulation system and urodynamic laboratory in a university hospital.
Participants: Six men (age, 33–59 years) with SCI incurred from 38 to 156 months before this study.
Intervention: semiconditional stimulation parameters were set during CMG and semiconditional stimulation on DPN by surface electrodes via Empi Focus stimulator was applied from 14 to 28 days, at home. Parameters about bladder function were measured before and after stimulation applied.
Result: All parameters for bladder after semiconditional stimulation were increased. Also, the vesicoureteral reflux and bladder wall deformity was improved in five of six patients.
Conclusion: Semiconditional electrical stimulation on DPN effectively suppresses neurogenic detrusor overactivity and distend the bladder physiologically in the SCI patient with a complicated bladder. The bladder capacity and compliance as well as the bladder wall deformity were improved as a result of this treatment.},

	abstract = {Overactive bladder (OAB) affects millions of people worldwide yet first-line treatments are often poorly tolerated and compliance rates are low. Neuromodulation works via afferent nerve modulation and offers a minimally invasive and reversible alternative treatment option for patients with OAB who have failed first-line therapy. Neuromodulation has revolutionized the management of OAB and is now well established as a safe and effective treatment for those refractory to conservative treatments. Multiple neuroanatomical pathways have been described for sacral neuromodulation including the S3 nerve root, pudendal nerve and tibial nerve. The S3 nerve root is currently the main treatment target and has the most long-term data on safety and efficacy to support its use. However, studies on neuromodulation at the pudendal nerve or posterior tibial nerve have been positive and their role in treatment continues to evolve. Most urologists who are experienced in voiding dysfunction can become proficient in each technique. Patient selection, surgical techniques and postoperative management differ slightly between approaches and urologists should familiarize themselves with these differences. Treatment of OAB should progress from the least to most invasive modality, and neuromodulation provides an attractive option owing to its minimally invasive approach, tolerability, positive outcomes and reversibility.},

Sixty-eight patients (29 men, 39 women, 70.0 ± 11.2 years) were studied. Detrusor overactivity was urodynamically defined as involuntary detrusor contractions of more than 15 cm H2O during the filling phase. Ten-hertz square waves of 1-ms pulse duration were used. A vaginal electrode was used in the women and an anal or surface electrode in the men. The stimulation was given for 15 minutes twice daily for 4 weeks. The efficacy was evaluated on the basis of a frequency/volume chart and urodynamic study before and after treatment. Results. Thirty-two patients in the active group and 28 in the sham group completed the study. The patient impressions were very good or good in 59\% and 39\% of the active and the sham group, respectively (P = 0.0354). On the cystometrogram, the bladder capacity at the first desire to void and the maximum desire to void increased significantly (P = 0.0104 and P = 0.0046, respectively) in the active group, but not in the sham group.

	abstract = {Aim
To evaluate percutaneous placement of electrodes adjacent to the dorsal genital nerve (DGN) and measure the effects of electrical stimulation on symptoms of urge incontinence during 1 week of home use.
Methods
Prospective, multicenter study. Subjects with urge incontinence underwent percutaneous placement of an electrode using local anesthetic. Test stimulation was applied to confirm electrode placement and cystometry was conducted with and without application of electrical stimulation. A 7-day testing period with the electrode connected to an external pulse generator was performed and was followed by a 3-day post-treatment test period. Bladder diaries, 24 hr pad tests, and adverse event queries were obtained.
Results
Twenty-one women were enrolled with an average age of 52.7 years and average duration of incontinence of 6 years. Percutaneous electrode placement required 5–10 min and was well tolerated. There was no relationship between the acute effects of stimulation on cystometry and the results during home use. Pad weight was reduced by ≥ 50\% in 13 of 17 subjects (76\%) (4 did not complete 24 hr pad testing) and 47\% of subjects reported ≥50\% reduction in incontinence episodes. Of the subjects who reported severe urgency at baseline, 81\% experienced a 50\% or greater improvement. Seven subjects experienced nine adverse events ranging from skin irritation to pain and bruising around the electrode exit site.
Conclusions
Electrodes to stimulate the DGN can be placed percutaneously and a home testing period showed a reduction in overactive bladder symptoms with DGN stimulation. Neurourol. Urodynam. 27:499–503, 2008. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Materials and Methods:Non-neurogenic patients {\textgreater}18 years with overactive bladder symptoms and UUI were included. Exclusion criteria were mainly stress urinary incontinence. Patients underwent 1 week of subject-controlled, on-demand, DGN stimulation, delivered by a percutaneously placed electrode near the DGN connected to an external stimulator (pulse-rate 20 Hz, pulse-width 300 μs). Patients activated the stimulator when feeling the urge to void and stimulated for 30 s. The amplitude was set at the highest tolerable level. A bladder diary including a severity score of the UUI episodes/void (scores: 0 = none, 1 = drops, 2 = dashes, 3 = soaks) and a padtest was kept 3 days prior to, during, and 3 days after the test period. The subjective improvement was also scored., Results: Seven patients (4 males/3 females) were enrolled, the mean age was 55 years (range 23–73). Six completed the test week. In the remaining patient the electrode migrated and was removed. 5/6 finalized the complete bladder diary, 1/6 recorded only the heavy incontinence episodes (score = 3). 4/6 completed the padtest. In all patients who finalized the bladder diary the number of UUI episodes decreased, in 3/5 with ≥60\%. The heavy incontinence episodes (score = 3) were resolved in 2/6 patients, and improved ≥80\% in the other 4. The severity score of the UUI episodes/void was improved with ≥ 60\% in 3/5 patients. The mean subjective improvement was 73\%., Conclusion: This feasibility study indicates that subject-controlled, on-demand DGN stimulation using a percutaneously placed electrode is possible over a longer time period, in a home setting, with a positive effect on non-neurogenic overactive bladder symptoms with UUI. Although the placement is an easy procedure, it is difficult to fixate the electrode to keep it in the correct position. Improvements in hardware, like a better fixated electrode and an easy to control stimulator, are necessary to make SODGNS a treatment possibility in the future.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: The study is part of the Rotterdam study, a population-based prospective cohort study among subjects aged 55 years and above. The prevalence at baseline was assessed in 6808 participants. Incidence of AF was investigated during a mean follow-up period of 6.9 years in 6432 persons. We identified 376 prevalent and 437 incident cases. Overall prevalence was 5.5\%, rising from 0.7\% in the age group 55-59 years to 17.8\% in those aged 85 years and above. The overall incidence rate was 9.9/1000 person-years. The incidence rate in the age group 55-59 years was 1.1/1000 person-years, rose to 20.7/1000 person-years in the age group 80-84 years and stabilized in those aged 85 years and above. Prevalence and incidence were higher in men than in women. The lifetime risk to develop AF at the age of 55 years was 23.8\% in men and 22.2\% in women.
CONCLUSION: In this prospective study in a European population, the prevalence and incidence of AF increased with age and were higher in men than in women. The high lifetime risk to develop AF was similar to North American epidemiological data.},

Oral anticoagulation with warfarin has been the pharmacologic standard for stroke risk reduction in patients with AF. When used with close attention to dosing and monitoring, warfarin is effective prophylactic therapy against thromboembolic stroke. However, it is underused by physicians, in part because of the known risks of adverse events with warfarin. Consequently, many patients with AF live with an avoidably elevated risk of stroke. New options, ie, oral anticoagulants with novel mechanisms of action, have recently been approved to reduce the risk of stroke in AF, and others are in development. These newer agents may address some of the complexities of warfarin use while providing similar or better efficacy and safety.},

The necessary selectivity of the e.m.g. recordings was achieved in two circumstances. In some subjects, previous motor nerve lesions distal to the point of stimulation had led to collateral sprouting with larger motor unit potentials. In other subjects an accessory deep peroneal nerve was present, so that lidocaine block of the main motor nerve left a small number of innervated motor units. 4. The axonal conduction velocities of the individual motor units ranged from 30 to 54 m/sec with most motor units between 35 and 45 m/sec. 5. Motor units which voluntarily could be driven continuously at frequencies below 10/sec had axonal conduction velocities between 30 and 45 m/sec. 6. Motor units which on voluntary drive responded only in high frequency bursts had axonal conduction velocities between 40 and 54 m/sec. 7. Motor units with intermediate voluntary discharge properties had intermediate axonal conduction velocities. 8. Thus a relationship was established between voluntary discharge properties and axonal conduction velocity.},

	abstract = {Objective 
        Both the startle reflex elicited by an intense acoustic or tactile stimulus and the perceived intensity of that stimulus can be diminished by a weak “prepulse” that precedes the startling stimulus. The present study examined whether prepulses can also diminish the pain produced by an intense electrical stimulus similar to that used to treat life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias in conscious patients with implantable cardioverter/defibrillators or transcutaneous pacemakers.
        Methods 
        Perceptual and pain thresholds for electrical shocks to the arm were determined in 20 adults. Participants then rated the painfulness of 25 electrical shocks that were 1.5 times the pain threshold (mean shock intensity, ≈160 V) and either presented alone or preceded (at 40–60 ms) by weak electrical prepulses equal to or 25\% above the perceptual threshold.
        Results 
        Prepulses significantly reduced the pain produced by the intense shocks. Individuals with the lowest pain thresholds experienced the greatest pain reduction with prepulses. In these more sensitive individuals, the most effective prepulses reduced perceived pain by 26\% across the entire test session and by 54\% in the initial block of five shocks.
        Conclusions 
        Prepulses may be useful in diminishing the pain associated with the therapeutic electrical shocks used to treat cardiac arrhythmias.},

	abstract = {Nociceptive sensory neurons are unusual in expressing voltage-gated inward currents carried by sodium channels resistant to block by tetrodotoxin (TTX) as well as currents carried by conventional TTX-sensitive sodium channels and voltage-dependent calcium channels. To examine how currents carried by each of these helps to shape the action potential in small-diameter dorsal root ganglion cell bodies, we voltage clamped cells by using the action potential recorded from each cell as the command voltage. Using intracellular solutions of physiological ionic composition, we isolated individual components of current flowing during the action potential with the use of channel blockers (TTX for TTX-sensitive sodium currents and a mixture of calcium channel blockers for calcium currents) and ionic substitution (TTX-resistant current measured by the replacement of extracellular sodium by N-methyl-d-glucamine in the presence of TTX, with correction for altered driving force). TTX-resistant sodium channels activated quickly enough to carry the largest inward charge during the upstroke of the nociceptor action potential (∼58\%), with TTX-sensitive sodium channels also contributing significantly (∼40\%), especially near threshold, and high voltage-activated calcium currents much less (∼2\%). Action potentials had a prominent shoulder during the falling phase, characteristic of nociceptive neurons. TTX-resistant sodium channels did not inactivate completely during the action potential and carried the majority (58\%) of inward current flowing during the shoulder, with high voltage-activated calcium current also contributing significantly (39\%). Unlike calcium current, TTX-resistant sodium current is not accompanied by opposing calcium-activated potassium current and may provide an effective mechanism by which the duration of action potentials (and consequently calcium entry) can be regulated.},

	abstract = {In voltage-dependent Na, K, or Ca channels, the probability of opening is modified by the membrane potential. This is achieved through a voltage sensor that detects the voltage and transfers its energy to the pore to control its gate. We present here the theoretical basis of the energy coupling between the electric field and the voltage, which allows the interpretation of the gating charge that moves in one channel. Movement of the gating charge constitutes the gating current. The properties are described, along with macroscopic data and gating current noise analysis, in relation to the operation of the voltage sensor and the opening of the channel. Structural details of the voltage sensor operation were resolved initially by locating the residues that make up the voltage sensor using mutagenesis experiments and determining the number of charges per channel. The changes in conformation are then analyzed based on the differential exposure of cysteine or histidine-substituted residues. Site-directed fluorescence labeling is then analyzed as another powerful indicator of conformational changes that allows time and voltage correlation of local changes seen by the fluorophores with the global change seen by the electrophysiology of gating currents and ionic currents. Finally, we describe the novel results on lanthanide-based resonance energy transfer that show small distance changes between residues in the channel molecule. All of the electrophysiological and the structural information are finally summarized in a physical model of a voltage-dependent channel in which a change in membrane potential causes rotation of the S4 segment that changes the exposure of the basic residues from an internally connected aqueous crevice at hyperpolarized potentials to an externally connected aqueous crevice at depolarized potentials.},

Myelination started between the 40th and the 45th day after mating (about 3 weeks before birth). From birth onwards the calibre spectrum consisted of a group of small fibres and a group of large fibres. During the first two postnatal months the point distribution of the number of myelin lamellae plotted against the axon diameter appeared more or less linear. This point distribution pattern became curved from the 10th postnatal week onwards, and a function of the general expression: nl = C0 + C1d + C2 log(d) could be fitted to describe the regression. In adult cats, the mean number of myelin lamellae/axon diameter ratio was about 30 in the group of small and about 15 in the group of large fibres. Observations on immature animals indicated that the difference between the two fibre groups could have been established already during the third postnatal week. Considerable myelin production took place after the age of 1 year. The cross sectional area of the myelin sheath in the alpha fibre group increased about 10\% after the age of 1 year, while in the gamma fibre group it increased as much as about 85\%.

	abstract = {The response of a spiking neuron to a stimulus is often characterized by its time-varying firing rate, estimated from a histogram of spike times. If the cell’s firing probability in each small time interval depends only on this firing rate, one predicts a highly variable response to repeated trials, whereas many neurons show much greater fidelity. Furthermore, the neuronal membrane is refractory immediately after a spike, so that the firing probability depends not only on the stimulus but also on the preceding spike train. To connect these observations, we investigated the relationship between the refractory period of a neuron and its firing precision. The light response of retinal ganglion cells was modeled as probabilistic firing combined with a refractory period: the instantaneous firing rate is the product of a “free firing rate,” which depends only on the stimulus, and a “recovery function,” which depends only on the time since the last spike. This recovery function vanishes for an absolute refractory period and then gradually increases to unity. In simulations, longer refractory periods were found to make the response more reproducible, eventually matching the precision of measured spike trains. Refractoriness, although often thought to limit the performance of neurons, may in fact benefit neuronal reliability. The underlying free firing rate derived by allowing for the refractory period often exceeded the observed firing rate by an order of magnitude and was found to convey information about the stimulus over a much wider dynamic range. Thus, the free firing rate may be the preferred variable for describing the response of a spiking neuron.},

	abstract = {Extracellular acidosis affects both permeation and gating of the expressed rat skeletal muscle Na+ channel (μ1). Reduction of the extracellular pH produced a progressive decrease in the maximal whole-cell conductance and a depolarizing shift in the whole-cell current-voltage relationship. A smaller depolarizing shift in the steady-state inactivation curve was observed. The pK of the reduction of maximal conductance was 6.1 over the pH range studied. An upper limit estimate of the pK of the shift of the half-activation voltage was 6.1. The relative reduction in the maximal whole-cell conductance did not change with higher [Na+]o. The conductance of single fenvalerate-modified Na+ channels was reduced by extracellular protons. Although the single-channel conductance increased with higher [Na+]o, the maximal conductances at pH 7.6, 7.0 and 6.0 did not converge at [Na+]oup to 280 mm, inconsistent with a simple electrostatic effect. A model incorporating both Na+ and H+ binding in the pore and cation binding to a Gouy-Chapman surface charge provided a robust fit to the single-channel conductance data with an estimated surface charge density of 1e−/439Å2. Neither surface charge nor proton block alone suffices to explain the effects of extracellular acidosis on Na+ channel permeation; both effects play major roles in mediating the response to extracellular pH.},

Conduction velocities of the peroneal motor nerve innervating the Extensor Digitorum Brevis (EDB) muscle were found to be in the range of 28-52 m/s and CVG innervating the greatest number appears to be in 40-48 m/s range, which consists of 70\% of all fibers.

	abstract = {Electric fields can stimulate excitable tissue by a number of mechanisms. A uniform long, straight peripheral axon is activated by the gradient of the electric field that is oriented parallel to the fiber axis. Cortical neurons in the brain are excited when the electric field, which is applied along the axon-dendrite axis, reaches a particular threshold value. Cardiac tissue is thought to be depolarized in a uniform electric field by the curved trajectories of its fiber tracts. The bidomain model provides a coherent conceptual framework for analyzing and understanding these apparently disparate phenomena. Concepts such as the activating function and virtual anode and cathode, as well as anode and cathode break and make stimulation, are presented to help explain these excitation events in a unified manner. This modeling approach can also be used to describe the response of excitable tissues to electric fields that arise from charge redistribution (electrical stimulation) and from time-varying magnetic fields (magnetic stimulation) in a self-consistent manner. It has also proved useful to predict the behavior of excitable tissues, to test hypotheses about possible excitation mechanisms, to design novel electrophysiological experiments, and to interpret their findings.},

	abstract = {1. Electrophysiological techniques are described which allow intracellular recording from peripheral myelinated axons of lizards and frogs for up to several hours. The sciatic and intramuscular axons studied here have resting potentials of -60 to -80 mV and action potentials (evoked by stimulation of the proximal nerve trunk) of 50-90 mV. They show a prominent depolarizing afterpotential (d.a.p.), which is present both in isolated axons and in axons still attached to their peripheral terminals. This d.a.p. has a peak amplitude of 5-20 mV at the resting potential, and decays with a half-time of 20-100 msec. 2. The peak amplitude of the d.a.p. is voltage-sensitive, increasing to up to 26 mV with membrane hyperpolarization. The d.a.p. disappears as the axon is depolarized to -60 to -45 mV, and does not appear to reverse with further depolarization. 3. The d.a.p. is not reduced when bath Ca is replaced by 2-10 m m divalent Mn or Ni. The d.a.p. is not reversed when axons depleted of Cl (by prolonged exposure to Cl-deficient, SO4-enriched solutions) are bathed in Cl-rich solutions. These results suggest that the d.a.p. is not mediated by a conductance change specific for Ca or Cl ions. Partial substitution of tetramethylammonium for bath Na, or addition of 10−5 m-tetrodotoxin to the normal bathing solution, reduces the amplitude of both the action potential and the d.a.p. 4. The amplitude of the d.a.p. is not sensitive to bath [K] over the range 1-7·5 m m, provided that all measurements are made at the same holding potential. This result argues that the d.a.p. is not mediated by accumulation of K outside the active axon. 5. Treatments expected to inhibit the Na—K exchange pump (cooling from 25 to 10 °C, or 0·15 m m-ouabain) do not enlarge or prolong the d.a.p., although they do abolish a slower hyperpolarizing afterpotential seen following repetitive stimulation. 6. The passive voltage response of the axon to small injected pulses of depolarizing or hyperpolarizing current shows a prominent, slowly decaying component with a time course similar to that of the d.a.p. Depolarizing current reduces the input resistance of the axon, and increases the rate of decay of both the passive voltage response and the d.a.p. There is a slight conductance increase during the peak of the d.a.p., but the same conductance increase can be produced by a comparable passive depolarization. 7. We conclude that the d.a.p. is due mainly to a passive capacitative current, probably resulting from discharge of the internodal axonal membrane capacitance through a resistive current pathway beneath or through the myelin sheath. We suggest that this slow capacitative discharge becomes evident as soon as most of the nodal ionic channels activated during the action potential have closed. An electrical model of the myelinated axon that incorporates the postulated internodal leakage pathway can account both for the prolonged d.a.p. recorded inside the axon, and for the potential profile recorded extra-axonally in or near the internodal periaxonal space.},

We have found that a low-threshold, persistent tetrodotoxin-resistant Na+ current, attributed to NaV1.9, is upregulated by GTP and its non-hydrolysable analogue GTP-γ-S, but not by GDP. Inclusion of GTP-γ-S (500 μm) in the internal solution led to an increase in maximal current amplitude of {\textgreater} 300 \% within 5 min. In current clamp, upregulation of persistent current was associated with a more negative threshold for action potential induction (by 15–16 mV) assessed from a holding potential of −90 mV. This was not seen in neurones without the low-threshold current or with internal GDP (P {\textless} 0.001). In addition, persistent current upregulation depolarized neurones. At −60 mV, internal GTP-γ-S led to the generation of spontaneous activity in initially silent neurones only when persistent current was upregulated. These findings suggest that regulation of the persistent current has important consequences for nociceptor excitability.},

Both drugs blocked whole-cell late Na+ current in a concentration-dependent manner. At 200 ms following the onset of a clamp step from −110 to −40 mV, the apparent K for block of late Na+ current by lignocaine was 57.8±15 μM (mean±s.e.mean, n=4). The value for benzocaine was 24.9±3.3 μM, (mean±s.e.mean, n=3). The effect of lignocaine on transient current, in randomly selected neurones, appeared variable (n=8, half-block from ∼50 to 400 μM). Half-block by benzocaine was not attained, but both whole-cell (n=11) and patch data suggested a high apparent K,{\textgreater}250 μM. Transient current always remained after late current was blocked. The voltage-dependence of residual late current steady-state inactivation was not shifted by 20 μM benzocaine (n=3), whereas 200 μM benzocaine shifted the voltage-dependence of transient current steady-state inactivation by −18.7±5.9 mV (mean±s.e.mean, n=4). In current-clamp, benzocaine (250 μM) could block subthreshold, voltage-dependent inward current, increasing the threshold for eliciting action potentials, without preventing their generation (n=2).

	abstract = {The effects of altering extracellular pH on late Na+ currents were investigated in large dorsal root ganglion neurons from rats (100–300g), using patch-clamp techniques. The late current amplitude was steeply dependent upon pH over a range which included normal physiological values: raising the pH from 7.3 to 8.3 approximately doubled the amplitude. Whole-cell late currents 60ms after depolarization to −30mV were blocked with an apparent pKa of 6.96. The pH-dependent changes in current amplitude could not be accounted for by the effects of altered surface charge. In recordings of unitary Na+ currents from outside-out membrane patches, acidification promoted channel opening to a reduced conductance level, near one-half of its maximal value. Acidification to pH{\textless}6.0 also changed the kinetics of the current recruited with the lowest threshold from non-inactivating to inactivating, with the elimination of late openings. We conclude that lowering pH from an initial alkaline or neutral value blocks late Na+ current by reducing the number of contributing channels while also reducing the single channel conductance. The pH dependence of late Na+ current helps to explain clinically relevant changes in neuronal excitability in response to small (i.e. {\textless}1 unit) perturbations in extracellular pH.},

Na+ currents in adult rat large dorsal root ganglion neurons were recorded during long duration voltage-clamp steps by patch clamping whole cells and outside-out membrane patches. Na+ current present {\textgreater}60 ms after the onset of a depolarizing pulse (late Na+ current) underwent partial inactivation; it behaved as the sum of three kinetically distinct components, each of which was blocked by nanomolar concentrations of tetrodotoxin. Inactivation of one component (late-1) of the whole cell current reached equilibrium during the first 60 ms; repolarizing to −40 or −50 mV from potentials of −30 mV or more positive gave rise to a characteristic increase in current (τ ≥ 5 ms), attributed to removal of inactivation. A second component (late-2) underwent slower inactivation (τ {\textgreater} 80 ms) at potentials more positive than −80 mV, and steady-state inactivation appeared complete at −30 mV. In small membrane patches, bursts of brief openings (γ = 13–18 pS) were usually recorded. The distribution of burst durations indicated that two populations of channel were present with inactivation rates corresponding to late-1 and late-2 macroscopic currents. The persistent Na+ current in the whole cell that extended to potentials more positive than −30 mV appeared to correspond to sporadic, brief openings that were recorded in patches (mean open time ∼0.1 ms) over a wide potential range. None of the three types of gating described corresponded to activation/inactivation gating overlap of fast transient currents.},

Dorsal root ganglion neurons from adult rats (≥200 g) were maintained in culture for between 1 and 3 days. Membrane currents generated by large neurons (50–75 μm apparent diameter) were recorded with the whole cell patch-clamp technique. Large neurons generated transient Na+ currents and at least two types of inward current that persisted throughout 200-ms voltage-clamp steps to +20 mV. One persistent current activated close to −35 mV (high threshold), whereas in about half of the cells another persistent current began to activate negative to −70 mV (low threshold). The high-threshold persistent current was identified as a Ca2+ current, as previously described in these neurons. The low-threshold current was reversibly suppressed either by replacing external Na+ with tetramethylammonium ions or by reducing external Na+ concentration ([Na+]) and simultaneously raising external [Ca2+]. It was blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX) with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant in the single nanomolar range. We conclude that the low-threshold current is a TTX-sensitive, persistent Na+ current. The persistent TTX-sensitive current contributed to steady-state membrane current from at least −70 mV to 0 mV, a wider potential range than predicted by activation-inactivation gating overlap for transient Na+ current. Because of its low threshold and fast activation kinetics, the persistent Na+ current is expected to play an important role in determining membrane excitability.},

	abstract = {1. The nature, distribution and function of rectifying channels in rat spinal root myelinated axons has been assessed with selective blocking agents and a variety of intracellular and extracellular recording techniques. 2. The electrotonic responses of roots poisoned with tetrodotoxin (TTX) to constant current pulses had fast (rise time much less than 1 ms) and slow components, which were interpreted in terms of Barrett \& Barrett's (1982) revised cable model for myelinated nerve. Depolarization evoked a rapid outward rectification (time constant, tau approximately 0.5 ms), selectively blocked by 4-aminopyridine (4AP, 1 mM), and a slow outward rectification (tau approximately 15 ms), selectively blocked by tetraethylammonium (TEA, 1 mM) or Ba2+ (0.5 mM). Hyperpolarization evoked an even slower inward rectification, selectively blocked by Cs+ (3 mM) but not by Ba2+. 3. From the different effects of the blocking agents on the fast and slow components of electrotonus, it was deduced (a) that the inward rectification is a property of the internodal axon, (b) that the slow outward rectifier is present at the nodes, and probably the internodes as well, and (c) that the 4AP-sensitive channels have a minor nodal and a major internodal representation. 4. TEA and Ba2+ reduced the accommodation of roots and fibres not poisoned with TTX to long current pulses, whereas 4AP facilitated short bursts of impulses in response to a single brief stimulus. 5. TEA and Ba2+ also abolished a late hyperpolarizing after-potential (peaking at 20-80 ms), while 4AP enhanced the depolarizing after-potential in normal fibres, and abolished an early hyperpolarizing after-potential (peaking at 1-3 ms) in depolarized fibres. Corresponding to the later after-potentials were post-spike changes in excitability and conduction velocity, which were affected similarly by the blocking agents. Cs+ increased the post-tetanic depression attributable to electrogenic hyperpolarization. 6. The physiological roles of the three different rectifying conductances are discussed. It is also argued that the prominent ohmic 'leak conductance', usually ascribed to the nodal axon, must arise in an extracellular pathway in series with the rectifying internodal axon.},

	abstract = {Whole nerve electrophysiologic procedures afford a battery of measures that can provide a noninvasive and objective index of the onset and progression of diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN). Advances in physiologic procedures, digital hardware, and mathematical models have allowed assessment of activity in slower conducting fibers, as well as measures that reflect changes in refractory periods and threshold excitability. These expanded options can augment standard measures of maximal conduction velocity and compound amplitude and greatly enhance the sensitivity of whole nerve measures to both structural (e.g., demyelination) and “nonstructural” (e.g., redistribution of ion channels) deficits associated with DPN. The mechanisms underlying the physiologic events in DPN are multifactorial and their sequence is complex, with different mechanisms contributing to change at overlapping, but distinct points in the progression. Factors influencing early change in velocity may differ from those contributing to chronic deficits and these mechanisms may also differ in their response to various putative therapies. This review attempts to summarize the pattern of whole nerve electrophysiologic change associated with DPN, outlines the strengths and limitations of the various measures that are feasible, and discusses the specific impact of known pathophysiologic mechanisms on these end points.},

This approach to determine resulting activation is only an approximation as it neglects the presence of the fibres on the applied field, in contrast to activity determined from a rigorous solution to the core conductor/excitable membrane equations. An alternative approach to determining relative excitability based on the induced transmembrane potential is presented, thereby allowing for current redistribution via the space constant of the target fibre. The paper critically examines the approximations made with activating functions, and concludes that as currently formulated the activating function has limitations in predicting relative excitability under a number of important conditions. In contrast, it is the induced (passive) transmembrane potential that provides a quantitatively reliable estimate of the tendency for fibres to excite.},

A subsequent degree of complexity introduces anisotropy in the monodomain, and finally the bundle is represented as an anisotropic bidomain comprised of the interstitial radial and longitudinal conductivities, the intracellular longitudinal conductivity and the fibre membrane between the two domains. In this latter model, electrical coupling from extracellular to intracellular space is included by means of the bidomain formulation.

In 11 patients affected by motor neurone disease and 11 patients affected by amyotrophie lateral sclerosis the F-wave velocity decreased significantly proceeding proximally and the minimum values were found in the central tract (52.51 ± 2.15 m/see in MND and 48.64 ± 5.60 m/sec in ALS).

Asynchronous firing of myelinated axons was absent in the majority of the experiments. 3. The method employs triangularly shaped electrical pulses, with a steep rise front and a slow exponential decay. The outward flow of current at the cathode fires conducted impulses in both larger and smaller axons, and the inward flow inactivates differentially the conduction in the smaller ones. 4. The differential effect of anodal currents rests upon the greater internal conductance and greater conduction velocity of larger fibres. 5. The method has the advantage over the conventional polarization block of simpler surgical preparation, longer nerve survival and minimal latency distortion. However, it cannot be applied in experiments requiring physiological stimulation of peripheral receptors.},

Within subjects, repeated measures design was employed with 29 healthy young volunteers. Sensory and motor thresholds and the force of the EIC were determined with biphasic pulses. Five different settings were tested in random order with IPIs ranging between 0 and 250 μ sec. Introducing IPIs during stimulation with biphasic pulses enhanced force production, with the increase related to the duration of the IPI. The sensory and motor thresholds, as well as the degree of discomfort associated with the induced contractions, were not affected by the IPIs. Biphasic pulses that incorporate IPIs may increase the effectiveness of NMES in terms of force production.},

These devices have classically employed symmetric biphasic current pulses in order to maintain a balance of charge. Prior electrophysiological and psychophysical studies in peripheral nerve show that adding an interphase gap (IPG) between the two phases makes stimulation more efficient than pulses with no gap. This led us to investigate the effect of IPG duration on retinal stimulation thresholds. Approach. We measured retinal ganglion cell (RGC) electrical thresholds in salamander retina and phosphene perceptual thresholds in epiretinal prosthesis patients during stimulation with different IPG lengths. We also built Hodgkin–Huxley-type models of RGCs to further study how IPG affects thresholds. Main results. In general, there was a negative exponential correlation between threshold and IPG duration. Durations greater than or equal to ∼0.5 ms reduced salamander RGC thresholds by 20–25\%. Psychophysical testing in five retinal prosthesis patients indicated that stimulating with IPGs can decrease perceptual thresholds by 10–15\%. Results from computational models of RGCs corroborated the observed behavior. Significance. Incorporating interphase gaps can reduce the power consumption of epiretinal prostheses and increase the available dynamic range of phosphene size and brightness.},

Twelve healthy volunteers participated in the study. Each subject participated in one session during which electrically induced contraction (EIC) forces of the ankle dorsiflexors were measured with five different IPI settings ranging from 0 to 400 μs. Forces of EICs were assessed with the electrodes placed either with the proximal electrode positioned over the common peroneal nerve and the second electrode over the dorsiflexor muscles or with both electrodes located over the dorsiflexor muscles. The order of electrode placements and of the different IPI settings was randomized across subjects. The results indicated that the introduction of a 100-μs-long IPI may enhance force production when one electrode is located over the common peroneal nerve. However, increasing the duration of the IPI beyond 100 μs did not result in further increase in force production. In contrast, the introduction of an IPI did not increase force production when both electrodes were located over the dorsiflexor muscles. These findings may help to optimize stimulation settings during functional electrical stimulation to prevent foot-drop.},

	abstract = {The study objective was to investigate the effects of an interphase interval (IPI) interposed between the two phases of a biphasic symmetric pulse, on electrically induced contraction (EIC) forces and fatigue during stimulation of the ankle dorsiflexors in individuals with an upper motor neuron lesion (UMNL). The dorsiflexor muscles of 20 subjects with UMNL routinely using functional electrical stimulation to correct a foot drop during ambulation, were electrically stimulated with biphasic pulses (250 µs phase duration and 35 Hz pulse frequency) using nine IPI durations (ranging from 0 to 400 µs). The induced muscle force and fatigue were measured. A significant positive correlation was found between IPI duration and induced muscle force. Introducing a 250 µs IPI significantly decreased rate of muscle fatigue compared to stimulation with no IPI (P {\textless} 0.05). Thus, the introduction of an IPI may reduce the current intensity required to achieve a specific force during functional electrical stimulation in individuals with UMNL. Reduction in muscle fatigue may shorten the conditioning period necessary for first time users of functional electrical stimulation.},

	abstract = {The effect of stimulus parameters on the recruitment characteristics of motor nerve was studied for regulated current monophasic and balanced charge biphasic stimuli. Results of a nerve model investigation indicated that the threshold difference between different diameter nerve fibers would be dependent on pulse width, the choice between monophasic and biphasic stimuli, and the delay between the primary cathodic and secondary anodic pulses. Threshold difference increased with decreasing pulse width, the greatest effects evident for pulses less than 100 μs. Biphasic stimulation with no delay between pulses provided greater threshold separation than monophasic stimulation or biphasic stimulation with delay. Animal experiments, in which recruitment in a nerve trunk composed of mixed diameter nerve fibers was examined, showed a decrease in recruitment slope with a decrease in pulse width and with the use of a biphasic, zero delay pulse. These results were examined through muscle force measurements using both a metal loop electrode encircling the nerve trunk and a nerve cuff electrode, i. e., a loop electrode in an insulating tube.},

One waveform was a biphasic, controlled-current pulse pair, each phase 50 μs in duration, with no delay between the phases (‘short pulse’, selected to excite primarily large axons), whereas in the second type each phase was 100 μs in duration, with a 400 μs delay between the phases (selected to excite axons of a broader spectrum of diameters). The sciatic nerve was examined for early axonal degeneration (EAD) seven days after the session of continuous stimulation. With both waveforms, the threshold stimulus current for axonal injury was greater than the current required to excite all of the nerve's large axons. The correlation between simple stimulus parameters and the amount of EAD was poor, especially with the ‘short pulse’ waveform, probably due to variability between animals. When the stimulus was normalised with respect to the current required to fully recruit the large axons, a good association between damage and stimulus amplitude emerged. The damage threshold was higher for the ‘short pulse’ waveform. The implications for clinical protocols are discussed.},

	abstract = {Maintaining a balance charge is one of the key factors to ensure a safe neural stimulation employing biphasic current stimulus. However, a zero net charge is difficult to achieve due to the fabrication variation of stimulation drivers. Moreover, even with a perfectly matched cathodic and anodic current stimulus, a non-zero residual charge is still built up due to the inter-pulse delay adopted in the stimulation pattern. During this period, the charge injected by the first stimulus pulse is leaked to the surrounding tissue and thus, the remaining charge cannot be completely removed by the following compensating current stimulus even with matched intensity. In this paper, we present a charge-balancing scheme by precisely controlling the pulse width of current stimulus. Charge balance is achieved by using the residual voltage as a feedback signal to control the pulse width of next stimulus. Simulated in Matlab/Simulink, the proposed scheme is shown to mitigate up to 15\% intensity mismatch of biphasic current pulses with 1ms inter-pulse delay. For a stimulus with constantly varying intensity, such as retinal and cochlear implants, the proposed scheme is also capable of maintaining a balance charge for a safe neural stimulation.},

	abstract = {Objective: To provide an analysis of stimulation parameters for deep brain stimulation (DBS). Methods: Synthesis of theoretical and empirical findings is used to provide guidance for the selection of stimulus parameters. Finite element modeling is used to investigate the effects of contact location and electrode geometry on the electric field, and to estimate the effects of current density distribution on the limit for non-damaging stimulation. Results: Anatomical targeting of DBS electrodes is complicated by the uncertainty of which neural elements are targeted and differences in the electric field distribution in fiber tracts and nuclei. Electrical targeting by selection of electrode geometry and stimulus waveform can alter the distribution of the electric field and control neural activation. The recommended charge density limit for DBS represents a liberal estimate for non-damaging stimulation. Short duration stimulus pulses reduce charge injection and increase the therapeutic window between therapeutic effects and side effects. Conclusions: There are several challenges to developing rational methods of selecting stimulus parameters including a large number of degrees of freedom, the unknown effects of stimulation, and the complexity of the responses. Significance: Understanding the fundamentals of electrical stimulation of the nervous system enables rational selection of stimulus parameters.},

Ten days after implantation, the electrodes were pulsed continuously for 7 h using charge-balanced, current-regulated, symmetric pulse pairs 400 mu s per phase in duration and at a repetition rate of 50 Hz. The results show that charge density (as measured at the surface of the stimulating electrode) and charge per phase interact in a synergistic manner to determine the threshold of stimulation-induced neural injury. This interaction occurs over a wide range of both parameters: for charge density from at least 10 to 800 mu C/cm/sup 2/, and for charge per phase from at least 0.05 to 5.0 mu C per phase.

The results confirmed the known effect of inter-electrode spacing and bipolar and tripolar recording configuration on the AP amplitude. It also demonstrates a crossover point where the amplitude of the tripolar recording is larger than the monopolar recording, an effect of the slower action potential conduction velocities in the worm.

	abstract = {Small-surface-area electrodes have successfully been used to preferentially activate cutaneous nociceptors, unlike conventional large area-electrodes, which preferentially activate large non-nociceptor fibers. Assessments of the strength-duration relationship, threshold electrotonus, and slowly increasing pulse forms have displayed different perception thresholds between large and small surface electrodes, which may indicate different excitability properties of the activated cutaneous nerves. In this study, the origin of the differences in perception thresholds between the two electrodes was investigated. It was hypothesized that different perception thresholds could be explained by the varying distributions of voltage-gated ion channels and by morphological differences between peripheral nerve endings of small and large fibers. A two-part computational model was developed to study activation of peripheral nerve fibers by different cutaneous electrodes. The first part of the model was a finite-element model, which calculated the extracellular field delivered by the cutaneous electrodes. The second part of the model was a detailed multicompartment model of an Aδ-axon as well as an Aβ-axon. The axon models included a wide range of voltage-gated ion channels: NaTTXs, NaTTXr, Nap, Kdr, KM, KA, and HCN channel. The computational model reproduced the experimentally assessed perception thresholds for the three protocols, the strength-duration relationship, the threshold electrotonus, and the slowly increasing pulse forms. The results support the hypothesis that voltage-gated ion channel distributions and morphology differences between small and large fibers were sufficient to explain the difference in perception thresholds between the two electrodes. In conclusion, assessments of perception thresholds using the three protocols may be an indirect measurement of the membrane excitability, and computational models may have the possibility to link voltage-gated ion channel activation to perception threshold measurements.},

	abstract = {The high impedance of glass micropipettes is widely recognized and appropriate attention is given to the amplifier input impedance required to reproduce bioelectric events recorded with these electrodes. However, similar precautions are often ignored when using metal microelectrodes, because it is often assumed that their impedance is much lower than micropipettes of comparable size. This paper reports on studies of the relationship between metal microelectrode area and amplifier input impedance required to record faithfully the action potential of frog skeletal muscle. The distortion of the EMG, as the amplifier input impedance was intentionally lowered in discrete steps, is quantitated in terms of the resultant per cent tilt of a square wave inserted along with the action potential. In addition, the impedance vs. frequency relationship is plotted for two metal microelectrodes of 100 and 1600 μ2 in area. This relationship shows the increased impedance at lower frequencies resulting from the capacitance produced by the electrical double layer. Results show that the minimum input impedance required for proper EMG recording ranges from 88 MΩ for steel electrodes of 500 μ2 in area to 1 megohm for electrodes of 125,000 μ2.},

The ratio of electrode polarization impedance with respect to the bulk resistance was calculated and plotted against concentration for each metal. Such a ratio shows the effect of the electrode polarization contribution as a function of electrolyte concentration when the bulk resistance of the solution changes. All metals showed a decrease of serial resistance R/sub p/ and capacitance C/sub p/ as a function of frequency. The medical stainless-steel electrode showed largest impedance values at lower frequencies compared to the other electrodes, and was concentration independent at all frequencies.

To design low-impedance interfaces a complete understanding of the physical processes contributing to the impedance is required. In this work a model describing these physical processes is validated and extended to quantify the effect of organic coatings and incubation time. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has been used to electrically characterize the interface for various electrode materials: platinum, platinum black, and titanium nitride; and varying electrode sizes: 1 cm/sup 2/, and 900 /spl mu/m/sup 2/. An equivalent circuit model comprising an interface capacitance, shunted by a charge transfer resistance, in series with the solution resistance has been fitted to the experimental results. Theoretical equations have been used to calculate the interface capacitance impedance and the solution resistance, yielding results that correspond well with the fitted parameter values, thereby confirming the validity of the equations. The effect of incubation time, and two organic cell-adhesion promoting coatings, poly-L-lysine and laminin, on the interface impedance has been quantified using the model. This demonstrates the benefits of using this model in developing a better understanding of the physical processes occurring at the interface in more complex, biomedically relevant situations.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to characterize the polarization impedance (resistance and capacitance) of several common metal/0.9\% saline interfaces operated at low-current density and to thereby provide a useful reference for those wishing to calculate the impedance of such electrodes. The series-equivalent resistance (R) and capacitive reactance (Xc) of stainless steel, platinum, silver, MP35N, palladium, aluminum, rhodium and copper electrodes, all having a surface areas S=0.005 cm2 and all in contact with 0.9\% saline, were measured as a function of frequency (100 Hz to 20 kHz) at low-current density (0.025 mA/cm2). For all the metals tested, both R and Xc decreased with increasing frequency and the relationships were linear on a log-log plot. That is, R and Xc exhibited power-law behavior (R=A/fα and Xc=B/fβ). However, it was not generally true that A=B and α=β=0.5 as stated in the Warburg low-current density model. Furthermore, the Fricke constant phase model in which α=β and ϕ=0.5πβ was found not to be applicable in general. In particular, the constraint that α=β was a good approximation for most of the metals tested in this study, but the constraint that ϕ=0.5πβ did not hold in general. Although the Warburg low-current density model provides a useful conceptual tool, it is not the most accurate representation of the electrode-electrolyte interface. The Fricke constant phase model is a better representation of electrode behavior, but it also may not be valid in general. We have found that a better representation is provided by the general power-law model R=A/fα and Xc=B/fβ, where A, B, α, and β depend on the species of both the metal and electrolyte and A and B depend, in addition, on electrode area. Using this model and the data presented in this study, the impedance of an electrode-electrolyte interface operated at low-current density may be calculated as \$\$Z = (0.005/S){\textbackslash}sqrt \{(Af{\textasciicircum}\{ - {\textbackslash}alpha \} ){\textasciicircum}2 + (Bf{\textasciicircum}\{ - {\textbackslash}beta \} ){\textasciicircum}2 \} ,\$\$ where S is the surface area of the electrode in cm2.},

With a low current density, the series-equivalent resistance and capacitance of a single electrode-electrolyte interface were found to vary almost inversely as the square root of frequency. In the frequency range studied, it was found that the reactance was very nearly equal to the resistance and both varied almost inversely as the square root of the frequency, verifying Warburg's postulate. When current density was increased, resistance decreased and capacitance increased at all frequencies studied; the change in each was most apparent in the low frequency region. As a consequence, it can be stated that the impedance of an electrode-electrolyte interface decreases with increasing current density.},

Methods: Small cutaneous nerves were activated electrically by small diameter (0.2 mm) cathodes, and large nerves were activated by ordinary patch electrodes. This new perception threshold tracking method combines perception threshold assessment and stimulation paradigms from conventional threshold tracking. Results: The strength-duration time-constant of large fibers (580 µs ± 160 µs) was lower than the time constant of small fibers (1060 µs ± 690 µs; P {\textless} 0.01, paired t-test). Threshold electrotonus showed similar threshold reductions to sub-threshold prepulses, except for 80 ms hyperpolarizing prepulses, to which small fibers showed less threshold reduction than large fibers (repeated-measures analysis of variance, Bonferroni, P = 0.006). Conclusions: This is a reliable method to investigate the membrane properties of small cutaneous nerve fibers in humans and may be used in clinical settings as a diagnostic or profiling tool.

Methods Sinusoidal transcutaneous stimulation (4Hz) was assessed psychophysically in healthy volunteers (n = 14) and neuropathic pain patients (n = 9). Pursuing laser Doppler imaging and single nociceptor recordings in vivo in humans (microneurography) and pigs confirmed the activation of “silent” C-nociceptors. Synchronized C-fiber compound action potentials were evoked in isolated human nerve fascicles in vitro. Live cell imaging of L4 dorsal root ganglia in anesthetized mice verified the recruitment of small-diameter neurons during transcutaneous 4-Hz stimulation of the hindpaw (0.4mA). Results Transcutaneous sinusoidal current (0.05–0.4mA, 4Hz) activated “polymodal” C-fibers (50\% at ∼0.03mA) and “silent” nociceptors (50\% at ∼0.04mA), intensities substantially lower than that required with transcutaneous 1-ms rectangular pulses (“polymodal” ∼3mA, “silent” ∼50mA). The stimulation induced delayed burning (nonpulsating) pain and a pronounced axon-reflex erythema, both indicative of C-nociceptor activation. Pain ratings to repetitive stimulation (1 minute, 4Hz) adapted in healthy volunteers by Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) –3 and nonpainful skin sites of neuropathic pain patients by NRS –0.5, whereas pain even increased in painful neuropathic skin by approximately NRS +2. Interpretation Sinusoidal electrical stimulation at 4Hz enables preferential activation of C-nociceptors in pig and human skin that accommodates during ongoing (1-minute) stimulation. Absence of such accommodation in neuropathic pain patients suggest axonal hyperexcitability that could be predictive of alterations in peripheral nociceptor encoding and offer a potential therapeutic entry point for topical analgesic treatment.

The present experiments were designed to determine the rate of habituation of perceptual responses to supraliminal painful and non-painful cutaneous stimuli. Changes in the perceived intensity of electrical stimuli applied to the digital nerves of the index finger were determined by a matching procedure in which subjects set the current applied to the index finger of one hand to match the perceived intensity of a stimulus train (5 pulses at 20 Hz) applied to the other index finger. Twenty-five volunteers took part in 7 experiments in which both non-painful (2.5 times the sensory threshold Ts) and painful (1.2 times the pain threshold Tp) stimulus trains were presented. Subjects were required to match the stimuli at 30 s intervals over a period of 7.5 min. The percentage change in matching current (Y) was fitted by the function Y= -20.7*[1 -exp (-0.56*t)] for both painful and non-painful stimuli repeated at 2 Hz. Responses recovered completely within 2 min of cessation of the stimulation. The degree of habituation increased or decreased with the rate of stimulus presentation. These results did not depend on changes in afferent fibre recruitment or fatigue because the afferent volley on the median nerve remained constant throughout the period of stimulation. Thus perceptual responses to the perceived intensity of supraliminal painful and non-painful stimuli delivered to the index finger habituate to the same extent, and the extent of the habituation is a function of the frequency of presentation of the stimulus.},

      A prospective, randomized study was performed to evaluate sacral nerve stimulation
         for the treatment of refractory urinary urge incontinence.
      
      
      Materials and Methods: 
      Primary outcome variables were obtained from voiding diaries. After baseline evaluation
         candidates who satisfied inclusion criteria were enrolled into the study. Test stimulation
         results determined eligibility for randomization into a stimulation (treatment) or
         delay (control) group. The stimulation group included 34 patients who underwent implantation
         and were followed for 6 months. The delay group comprised 42 patients who received
         standard medical therapy for 6 months and then were offered implantation. The stimulation
         group completed a therapy evaluation test (on versus off) after 6 months.
      
      
      Results: 
      At 6 months the number of daily incontinence episodes, severity of episodes and absorbent
         pads or diapers replaced daily due to incontinence were significantly reduced in the
         stimulation compared to the delay group (all p {\textless}0.0001). Of the 34 stimulation group
         patients 16 (47\%) were completely dry and an additional 10 (29\%) demonstrated a greater
         than 50\% reduction in incontinence episodes 6 months after implantation. Efficacy
         appeared to be sustained for 18 months. During the therapy evaluation test the group
         returned to baseline levels of incontinence when stimulation was inactivated. Urodynamic
         testing confirmed that sacral nerve stimulation did not adversely affect voiding function.
         Complications included implantable pulse generator site pain in 15.9\% of the patients,
         implant site pain in 19.1\% and lead migration in 7.0\%. Surgical revision was required
         in 32.5\% of patients with implants to resolve a complication. There were no reports
         of permanent injury or nerve damage.
      
      
      Conclusions: 
      Sacral nerve stimulation is safe and effective in treating refractory urinary urge
         incontinence.},

Methods Prospective, multicenter study. Subjects with urge incontinence underwent percutaneous placement of an electrode using local anesthetic. Test stimulation was applied to confirm electrode placement and cystometry was conducted with and without application of electrical stimulation. A 7-day testing period with the electrode connected to an external pulse generator was performed and was followed by a 3-day post-treatment test period. Bladder diaries, 24 hr pad tests, and adverse event queries were obtained. Results Twenty-one women were enrolled with an average age of 52.7 years and average duration of incontinence of 6 years. Percutaneous electrode placement required 5–10 min and was well tolerated. There was no relationship between the acute effects of stimulation on cystometry and the results during home use. Pad weight was reduced by ≥ 50\% in 13 of 17 subjects (76\%) (4 did not complete 24 hr pad testing) and 47\% of subjects reported ≥50\% reduction in incontinence episodes. Of the subjects who reported severe urgency at baseline, 81\% experienced a 50\% or greater improvement.

	abstract = {Objectives To evaluate the effect of subject-controlled, on-demand, dorsal genital nerve stimulation on non-neurogenic urgency urinary incontinence in a domestic setting. Materials and Methods Non-neurogenic patients {\textgreater}18 years with overactive bladder symptoms and urgency urinary incontinence were included. Exclusion criteria were mainly stress urinary incontinence. Patients underwent one week of subject-controlled, on-demand, dorsal genital nerve stimulation, delivered by a percutaneously placed electrode near the dorsal genital nerve connected to an external stimulator (pulse-rate 20 Hz, pulse-width 300 μs). Patients activated the stimulator when feeling the urge to void and stimulated for 30 s. The amplitude was set at the highest tolerable level. A bladder diary including a severity score of the urgency urinary incontinence episodes/void (scores: 0=none, 1=drops, 2=dashes, 3=soaks) and a padtest was kept 3 days prior to, during, and 3 days after the test period. The subjective improvement was also scored. Results Seven patients (4 males / 3 females) were enrolled, the mean age was 55 years (range 23-73). Six completed the test week. In the remaining patient the electrode migrated and was removed. 5/6 finalized the complete bladder diary, 1/6 recorded only the heavy incontinence episodes (score=3). 4/6 completed the padtest. In all patients who finalized the bladder diary the number of urgency urinary incontinence episodes decreased, in 3/5 with ≥60\%. The heavy incontinence episodes (score=3) were resolved in 2/6 patients, and improved ≥ 80\% in the other 4. The severity score of the urgency urinary incontinence episodes/void was improved with ≥60\% in 3/5 patients. The mean subjective improvement was 73\%. Conclusion This feasibility study indicates that subject-controlled, on-demand dorsal genital nerve stimulation using a percutaneously placed electrode is possible over a longer time period, in a home setting, with a positive effect on non-neurogenic overactive bladder symptoms with urgency urinary incontinence. Although the placement is an easy procedure, it is difficult to fixate the electrode to keep it in the correct position. Improvements in hardware, like a better fixated electrode and an easy to control stimulator, are necessary to make SODGNS a treatment possibility in the future.},

In this study, the acute effect of DGN stimulation on the rectal cross-sectional area is investigated. Method Ten female patients (median age 60 years) with idiopathic faecal incontinence were included in the study. Stimulation was applied via plaster electrodes with the maximum tolerable amplitude (pulse width was 200 μs at a pulse rate of 20 Hz). Three series of pressure-controlled phasic (10, 20 and 30 cm H2O) and stepwise (5–30 cm H2O in steps of 5 cm H2O) rectal distensions were conducted (unstimulated, stimulated, unstimulated), and the rectal cross-sectional area (CSA) was measured with impedance planimetry. Results All patients completed the investigation. The median stimulation amplitude was 21 (8.5–27) mA. Comparing stimulated with unstimulated phasic distension, there was no significant difference in the median rectal CSA. Comparing stimulated with unstimulated stepwise distension, there was no significant difference in the median rectal CSA. Neither the rectal pressure-CSA relationship (CSA/PR) nor the rectal wall tension changed during stimulation. Conclusion No acute effect on rectal CSA during pressure-controlled distension was demonstrated during DGN stimulation.},

      The feasibility of automatic event driven electrical stimulation of the dorsal penile/clitoral
         nerve in the treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) was evaluated in
         individuals with spinal cord injury.
      
      
      Materials and Methods: 
      The study included 2 women and 14 men older than 18 years with NDO, bladder capacity
         below 500 ml and complete or incomplete suprasacral spinal cord injury. Detrusor pressure
         (Pdet) was recorded during ordinary, natural bladder filling. In a similar subsequent
         recording Pdet was used to trigger electrical stimulation when pressure exceeded 10
         cm H
         2O.
      
      
      Results: 
      Of the 16 patients enrolled in this study 13 had increased bladder capacity together
         with a storage pressure decrease as a result of automatic, event driven electrical
         stimulation. In 2 patients stimulation could not inhibit the first undesired contraction,
         leakage occurred and finally 1 could not tolerate stimulation. During stimulated filling
         Pdet never exceeded 55 cm H
         2O. Thus, storage pressure was sufficiently low to prevent kidney damage. An average
         bladder capacity increase of 53\% was achieved.
      
      
      Conclusions: 
      This study demonstrates the feasibility of automatic, event driven electrical stimulation
         in the treatment of NDO. Although the setup in this experiment is not suitable in
         a clinical setting, the treatment modality is promising and it warrants further investigation.},

A literature search was performed using Pub Med, Web of Science, and Scopus databases (1980 to April 2012) for clinical trials of DGN stimulation in patients with detrusor overactivity. Seventeen studies were found in the literature. In the studies, different patterns of DGN stimulation were applied. The patterns were either continuous, conditional, or semi-conditional; on an acute or on a chronic basis. DGN stimulation lead to improvement of bladder capacity and reduction in urgency and/or incontinence episodes in many patients. The outcomes of conditional stimulation were comparable to continuous stimulation with respect to improvement of bladder capacity. The publications give evidence that DGN stimulation increases bladder capacity and suppresses involuntary detrusor contractions. Implantable DGN stimulation electrodes can open the way for more prolonged studies in larger patient groups to assess the effectiveness of chronic DGN stimulation in patients with OAB syndrome. Chronic DGN stimulation seems to be of value in the management of OAB syndrome.},

Such reflexes were much enhanced following repetitive conditioning stimulation of the same afferents at 20 Hz for 5 min. 3 The reflex enhancement lasted more than 1 h after the conditioning stimulation. The effect was not prevented by a preceding complete transection of the sympathetic supply to the bladder. A prolonged suppression of the reflex was obtained after conditioning stimulation of afferents in the dorsal clitoris nerves. 4 It is proposed that the prolonged modulations of the micturition reflex represent physiological adaptive processes, which preserve a flawless function of the bladder during life.

This review describes the evidence from established and experimental therapies that use electrical nerve stimulation to treat lower urinary tract dysfunction.

Methods
Clinical studies on established treatments such as percutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation (P-PTNS), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) and sacral anterior root stimulation (SARS) are evaluated. In addition, clinical evidence from experimental therapies such as dorsal genital nerve (DGN) stimulation, pudendal nerve stimulation, magnetic nerve stimulation and ankle implants for tibial nerve stimulation are evaluated.

Results
SNS and P-PTNS have been investigated with high-quality studies that have shown proven efficacy for the treatment for overactive bladder (OAB). SARS has proven evidence-based efficacy in spinal cord patients and increases the quality of life. TENS seems inferior to other OAB treatments such as SNS and P-PTNS but is noninvasive and applicable for ambulant therapy. Results from studies on experimental therapies such as pudendal nerve stimulation seem promising but need larger study cohorts to prove efficacy.

Conclusion
Neurostimulation therapies have proven efficacy for bladder dysfunction in patients who are refractory to other therapies.

Significance
Refinement of neurostimulation therapies is possible. The aim should be to make the treatments less invasive, more durable and more effective for the treatment of lower urinary tract dysfunction.},

	abstract = {Purpose: 
      We performed a prospective multicomponent study to determine whether subjective and
         objective bladder sensation instruments may provide data on sensory dysfunction in
         patients with overactive bladder.
      
      
      Materials and Methods: 
      We evaluated 70 prospectively enrolled patients with urodynamics and questionnaires
         on validated urgency (Urgency Perception Score), general overactive bladder (Urogenital
         Distress Inventory) and quality of life (Incontinence Impact Questionnaire). We first
         sought a correlation between sensory specific (Urgency Perception Score) and quality
         of life questionnaire scores. We then assessed a correlation between sensory questionnaire
         scores and urodynamic variables, exploring the hypothesis that certain urodynamic
         parameters may be bladder sensation measures. We evaluated 2 urodynamic derivatives
         (first sensation ratio and bladder urgency velocity) to increase sensory finding discrimination.
      
      
      Results: 
      We noted a moderate correlation between the Urgency Perception Score (0.56) and the
         Urogenital Distress Inventory (0.74) vs the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (each
         p {\textless}0.01). A weak negative correlation was seen between Urgency Perception Score and
         bladder capacity (−0.25, p {\textless}0.05). No correlation was noted for the other urodynamics
         parameters. First sensation ratio and bladder urgency velocity statistically significantly
         correlated with the Urgency Perception Score despite the lesser or absent correlation
         associated with the individual components of these derivatives.
      
      
      Conclusions: 
      Bladder sensation questionnaires may be valuable to identify patients with sensory
         dysfunction and provide additional data not obtained in generalized symptom questionnaires.
         Urodynamic variables correlated with bladder sensation questionnaire scores and may
         be an objective method to assess sensory dysfunction.},

	abstract = {Purpose: 
      This 5-year, prospective, multicenter trial evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy
         of sacral neuromodulation in patients with refractory urge incontinence, urgency frequency
         and retention.
      
      
      Materials and Methods: 
      A total of 17 centers worldwide enrolled 163 patients (87\% female). Following test
         stimulation 11 patients declined implantation and 152 underwent implantation using
         InterStim
         ®. Of those treated with implantation 96 (63.2\%) had urge incontinence, 25 (16.4\%)
         had urgency frequency and 31 (20.4\%) had retention. Voiding diaries were collected
         annually for 5 years. Clinical success was defined as 50\% or greater improvement from
         baseline in primary voiding diary variable(s).
      
      
      Results: 
      Data for all implanted cases were reported. For patients with urge incontinence mean
         leaking episodes per day decreased from 9.6 ± 6.0 to 3.9 ± 4.0 at 5 years. For patients
         with urgency frequency mean voids per day decreased from 19.3 ± 7.0 to 14.8 ± 7.6,
         and mean volume voided per void increased from 92.3 ± 52.8 to 165.2 ± 147.7 ml. For
         patients with retention the mean volume per catheterization decreased from 379.9 ±
         183.8 to 109.2 ± 184.3 ml, and the mean number of catheterizations decreased from
         5.3 ± 2.8 to 1.9 ± 2.8. All changes were statistically significant (p {\textless}0.001). No
         life threatening or irreversible adverse events occurred. In 102 patients 279 device
         or therapy related adverse events were observed. At 5 years after implantation 68\%
         of patients with urge incontinence, 56\% with urgency frequency and 71\% with retention
         had successful outcomes.
      
      
      Conclusions: 
      This long-term study demonstrates that InterStim therapy is safe and effective for
         restoring voiding in appropriately selected cases refractory to other forms of treatment.},

	abstract = {In recent years, botulinum-A neurotoxin has increasingly been used to manage lower urinary tract symptoms, including overactive bladder and detrusor overactivity (DO), either due to neurogenic or idiopathic etiology. Techniques, doses, and preparation vary. Although many studies have reported promising results regarding efficacy, potential adverse effects, particularly urinary retention, have been less comprehensively reported. We performed a critical review of published studies evaluating botulinum treatment for overactive bladder and its reported effects on voiding function. Acute urinary retention is recognized, though rare. Chronic urinary retention is inconsistently reported; it appears to be more common in neurogenic DO, but it can occur in idiopathic DO. Increased postvoid residuals have been reported by several studies, but the clinical significance that investigators attach to the observation varies. The detrimental effect of retention on quality of life can be considerable. Accordingly, patients should be fully counseled on the risks of urinary retention and trained in intermittent catheterization before the procedure. Postvoid residual assessment should be part of follow-up and patients should be warned of possible presentations.},

This article considers botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) injection as an alternative treatment to surgery in patients with DO who do not respond to anticholinergic therapy.

Review articles were not included. Abstracts were cited only if they contained important new information.

This article will overview current thoughts on the pharmacological and clinical basis for the different classes of drugs currently used for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms/overactive bladder syndrome/and detrusor overactivity. Individual drugs are not discussed in detail; particular consideration is given to therapeutic aspects of the management of the elderly patient.
        
          Recent findings An extensive literature review confirms the rationale for using antimuscarinic drugs, and that the currently used drugs are efficacius with an acceptable tolerability and safety. In patients resistant to antimuscarinics, botulinum toxin may be an alternative – the vanilloids resiniferatoxin and capsaicin have very limited use. New therapeutic options with positive proof-of-concept studies, but with limited clinical experience, are β3 adrenoceptor agonists and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Positive signals have been found for other classes of drugs (e.g., gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists, neurokinin receptor-1 antagonists), but available information is not sufficient for proper assessment.
        
          Summary Antimuscarinic drugs remain the first-line treatment of the overactive bladder and a favorable efficacy/tolerability-safety ratio can be confirmed. Promising new alternatives are emerging and future controlled studies will decide their place in the therapeutic arsenal.},

	abstract = {Objective
Estimate the prevalence of urinary incontinence (UI), overactive bladder (OAB), and other lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) among men and women in five countries using the 2002 International Continence Society (ICS) definitions.
Methods
This population-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted between April and December 2005 in Canada, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and the United Kingdom using computer-assisted telephone interviews. A random sample of men and women aged ≥ 18 yr residing in the five countries and who were representative of the general populations in these countries was selected. Using 2002 ICS definitions, the prevalence estimates of storage, voiding, and postmicturition LUTS were calculated. Data were stratified by country, age cohort, and gender.
Results
A total of 19,165 individuals agreed to participate; 64.3\% reported at least one LUTS. Nocturia was the most prevalent LUTS (men, 48.6\%; women, 54.5\%). The prevalence of storage LUTS (men, 51.3\%; women, 59.2\%) was greater than that for voiding (men, 25.7\%; women, 19.5\%) and postmicturition (men, 16.9\%; women, 14.2\%) symptoms combined. The overall prevalence of OAB was 11.8\%; rates were similar in men and women and increased with age. OAB was more prevalent than all types of UI combined (9.4\%).
Conclusions
The EPIC study is the largest population-based survey to assess prevalence rates of OAB, UI, and other LUTS in five countries. To date, this is the first study to evaluate these symptoms simultaneously using the 2002 ICS definitions. The results indicate that these symptoms are highly prevalent in the countries surveyed.},

The extracellular action potentials were shown to remain unchanged if the fiber diameter and the volume conductor geometry are scaled by the same factor (principle of corresponding states), both in an unbounded homogeneous medium and in an inhomogeneous volume conductor.

The effect of electrical simulation was investigated using both a homogeneous volume conductor and a more realistic model of the spinal cord. An important feature of dorsal column nerve fibers is the presence of myelinated collaterals perpendicular to the rostro-caudal fibers. It was found that transmembrane potentials, due to external monopolar stimulation, at the node at which a collateral is attached, is significantly influenced by the presence of the collateral. It is concluded that both excitation threshold and blocking threshold of dorsal column fibers are decreased up to 50\% compared to unbranched fibers.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The myelin sheath is normally regarded as an electrical insulator. Low values of radial conductance and capacitance have been measured, and in electrical models of myelinated axons the contribution of longitudinal conduction within the sheath has been ignored. According to X-ray diffraction studies, however, myelin sheaths comprise alternate lipid and aqueous layers, and the latter may be expected to have a low resistivity. We propose a new model of myelinated axons in which the aqueous layers within the myelin provide appreciable longitudinal and radial conductance, the latter via a spiral pathway. We have investigated the likely contribution of these conductive paths within the myelin to the electrical properties of a human motor nerve fibre by computer simulation, representing the myelin sheath as a series of interconnecting parallel lamellae. With this new model, action potential conduction has been simulated along a 20-node cable, and the electrotonic responses to 100-ms depolarizing and hyperpolarizing current pulses have been simulated for a uniformly polarized fibre. We have found that the hypothesis of a longitudinally conducting myelin sheath improves our previous model in two ways: it is no longer necessary to make implausible assumptions about the resistivity or width of the periaxonal space to simulate realistic electrotonus, and the conduction velocity is appreciably faster (by 8.6\%).},

The effects of blocked nodal or internodal potassium (fast or slow) channels on the fibre action potentials, early and late adaptations to 30-ms suprathreshold slowly increasing depolarizing stimuli have been examined. The effects of the same channels on accommodation after the termination of a prolonged (100 ms) hyperpolarizing current pulse have also been investigated. By removing the nodal fast potassium conductance the action potentials of the sensory fibres are considerably broader than those of the motor neurons. For both types of fibres, the blocked nodal slow potassium channels have a substantially smaller effect on the action potential repolarization. When the suprathreshold depolarizing current intensity is increased, the onset of the spike burst occurs sooner, which is common in the behaviour of the fibres. The most striking differences in the burst activity during early adaptation have been found between the fibres when the nodal fast potassium channels are blocked. The results obtained confirm the fact that the motor fibres adapt more quickly to sustained depolarizing current pulses than the sensory ones. The results also show that normal human motor and sensory fibres cannot be excited by a 100-ms hyperpolarizing current pulse, even at the threshold level. When removing the potassium channels in the nodal or internodal axolemma, the posthyperpolarization increase in excitability is small, which is common in the behaviour of the fibres. However, anode break excitation can be simulated in the fibres with simultaneous removal of the potassium channels under the myelin sheath, and this is more pronounced in the human sensory fibres than in motor fibres. This phenomenon can also be found when the internodal and some of the nodal (fast or slow) potassium channels are simultaneously blocked.},

	abstract = {The number of motor units in the thenar muscle group was calculated by dividing the surface electromyogram and twitch force, in maximal stimulation of the median nerve, by estimates of the average electromyogram and twitch force from single units. The following three techniques were used to estimate the average electromyogram from single units: spike-triggered averaging from units recorded with a needle electrode, intramuscular microstimulation of motor nerve branches, and graded whole nerve stimulation at the wrist. The first two techniques also provided independent estimates of motor unit numbers based on the average force generated by single units. The five estimates (three based on the electromyogram and two on force) ranged from 116 to 170 motor units in the thenar group. Correcting for cancellation when unit responses sum to form the compound action potential or twitch increased the estimated number of units, which ranged from 130 to 179. The estimates were not statistically different from one another but were substantially lower than some previous electrophysiological estimates based on graded whole nerve stimulation. The recruitment pattern of single units during whole nerve stimulation was recorded and simulated mathematically. The most likely reason for the higher estimates in previous studies using graded whole nerve stimulation is shown to be alternation of motor units. Potential errors in all the techniques are discussed and compared.},

After a concise summary of the estimation formalism, the numerical implementation of the procedure is given followed by the elaboration of a number of aspects of a practical nature. It is shown that reliable estimates of both fast and slow fiber distributions can be derived. The sensitivity of the procedure to various possible error sources is investigated. It is seen that many factors can be dealt with, properly including recording noise and incorrect determination of recording distance. Possible branching of the nerve can also be traced. A correct description of the amplitude and the waveshape of the single-fiber action potentials appears to be the most critical factor in a practical application.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

In some cases complete denervation of a muscle was found. It appeared that these findings were not due to plexus lesions or spinal root avulsions, but that they were caused by the lesion of the central nervous system. In 10 patients with slight concussion no spontaneous activity was found. Fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves occurred in the paretic limbs in 20 out of 21 patients with hemisyndromes due to cerebrovascular accidents. The spontaneous activity appeared after 2–3 weeks (as in peripheral nerve lesions) and disappeared or diminished considerably within 6 months. The denervation caused by the central lesion was attended by normal motor and sensory nerve conduction (apart from disturbed motor conduction to totally denervated and subsequently reinnervated muscles). It is concluded that lesions of the central nervous system may cause a dysfunction of anterior horn cells which leads to axonal degeneration, probably in the form of a dying-back process. Apparently in the majority of the anterior horn cells this dysfunction is temporary, so that axonal regeneration and reinnervation soon take place.},

Stimulus–response curves were significantly different: threshold was much higher, the slope of the curves reduced and the spread of the thresholds greater in the CIDP group. The strength–duration time constant (τSD) was significantly shorter and the rheobase higher in the CIDP group. In the recovery cycle, the CIDP group had less refractoriness, supernormality and late subnormality than healthy controls, but the duration of the relatively refractory period was normal. These changes in τSD and the recovery cycle were not those previously predicted. There were no consistent changes in threshold electrotonus, suggesting that, for the studied axons, there are no consistent changes in accommodation properties that depend on internodal conductances. It is difficult to explain these changes in excitability on the basis of a change in membrane potential, or solely as the result of demyelination, and it is possible that other morphological factors such as variable remyelination and inflammatory oedema affected axonal excitability in the patients.},

Mutations in mouse Scn8a result in neurological disorders, including paralysis, ataxia, and dystonia. In addition, Scn8a has been observed to mediate unique persistent and resurgent currents in cerebellar Purkinje cells (Raman et al., 1997). To examine the functional characteristics of this channel, we constructed a full-length cDNA clone encoding the mouse Scn8a sodium channel and expressed it in Xenopus oocytes. The electrophysiological properties of the Scn8a channels were compared with those of the Rat1 and Rat2 sodium channels. Scn8a channels were sensitive to tetrodotoxin at a level comparable to that of Rat1 or Rat2. Scn8a channels inactivated more rapidly and showed differences in their voltage-dependent properties compared with Rat1 and Rat2 when only the α subunits were expressed. Coexpression of the β1 and β2 subunits modulated the properties of Scn8a channels, but to a lesser extent than for the Rat1 or Rat2 channels. Therefore, all three channels showed similar voltage dependence and inactivation kinetics in the presence of the β subunits. Scn8a channels coexpressed with the β subunits exhibited a persistent current that became larger with increasing depolarization, which was not observed for either Rat1 or Rat2 channels. The unique persistent current observed for Scn8a channels is consistent with the hypothesis that this channel is responsible for distinct sodium conductances underlying repetitive firing of action potentials in Purkinje neurons.},

	abstract = {Hippocampal CA1 neurons exposed to zero-[Ca2+] solutions can generate periodic spontaneous synchronized activity in the absence of synaptic function. Experiments using hippocampal slices showed that, after exposure to zero-[Ca2+]0 solution, CA1 pyramidal cells depolarized 5–10mV and started firing spontaneous action potentials. Spontaneous single neuron activity appeared in singlets or was grouped into bursts of two or three action potentials. A 16-compartment, 23-variable cable model of a CA1 pyramidal neuron was developed to study mechanisms of spontaneous neuronal bursting in a calcium-free extracellular solution. In the model, five active currents (a fast sodium current, a persistent sodium current, an A-type transient potassium current, a delayed rectifier potassium current, and a muscarinic potassium current) are included in the somatic compartment. The model simulates the spontaneous bursting behavior of neurons in calcium-free solutions. The mechanisms underlying several aspects of bursting are studied, including the generation of triplet bursts, spike duration, burst termination, after-depolarization behavior, and the prolonged inactive period between bursts. We show that the small persistent sodium current can play a key role in spontaneous CA1 activity in zero-calcium solutions. In particular, it is necessary for the generation of an after-depolarizing potential and prolongs both individual bursts and the interburst interval.},

	abstract = {Motor unit number estimation (MUNE) was introduced in 1971 as a way of providing an objective and meaningful estimate of axon loss in diseases affecting the motor system. Over the last 30 years, different methods of MUNE have been proposed, with each having specific strengths and limitations. The goal of this paper is to review the available methods, and to present data generated using MUNE in a variety of disease entities. The incremental, multiple point stimulation, spike-triggered averaging, F-wave, and statistical methods of MUNE are reviewed, along with data obtained using these methods in patients with neuropathy, motor neuron disorders, and muscle disease. All methods reviewed have theoretical concerns associated with them. However, with the exception of the spike-triggered averaging method, all give results in normal subjects that are quite similar. MUNE has been of great value in assessing progression of motor neuron disease, and has also shown promise in the assessment of generalized neuropathy. Despite the lack of a perfect method for performing MUNE, it has great clinical value in the assessment of progressive motor axon loss. Further refinements in the method will likely increase its utility in the future.},

	abstract = {Seppäläinen, A. M., and Hernberg, S. (1972).Brit. J. industr. Med.,29, 443-449. Sensitive technique for detecting subclinical lead neuropathy. Subclinical neuropathy was studied in 39 male lead workers. Although 31 had a diagnosis of poisoning, all were without clinical signs of neurological impairment. A standard electromyogram revealed abnormalities (fibrillations and/or diminished number of motor units) in 24 men. The mean maximum conduction velocities (MCV) of the ulnar and median nerve were significantly lower in the group of lead workers as compared with an age-matched control group. Measurement of the conduction velocity of the slower fibres (CVSF) of the ulnar nerve proved to be a very sensitive indicator of lead damage. This measurement was done as a modification of Hopf's technique using a partial antidromic block. A combination of this variable and the distal latency of the median nerve discriminated lead workers from controls better than any other combinations. The findings are consistent with slight neuropathy. They further show that lead also affects certain portions of the fibres in the proximal part of the nerve.
The neurophysiological findings of the lead workers were collated to form a neurophysiological score (NF score). This score was used to compare the neurophysiological state with the degree of present lead effect, as judged from a rigid classification based on defined subjective symptoms and results of laboratory tests. There was poor agreement between the severity of lead effect and the NF score. No isolated laboratory test correlated with the neurophysiological findings.
From these results it appears that subclinical nerve damage can be detected in lead workers with no clinical neurological symptoms. Measurement of the CVSF is a particularly sensitive method for this purpose. The lack of correlation between the severity of subclinical nerve damage and the intensity of lead effect, as judged by commonly used criteria, suggests that nerve damage is produced independently of other manifestations of poisoning. This observation indicates the need for further studies on the value of present acceptable limits of lead exposure from the point of view of the nervous system.},

Evidence for amplification of synaptic current by voltage-gated channels in dendrites of neocortical pyramidal neurons was demonstrated by examining the effect of specific channel blocking agents on the current arriving at the soma during iontophoresis of glutamate at a distal site on the apical dendrite. 2. Dendritic noninactivating Na+ channels were implicated in this voltage-dependent amplification of the transmitted current because it was maintained for {\textgreater} 1 s and because tetrodotoxin (TTX) eliminated much of this amplification. 3. Specific blockers of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors reduced the amplitude of the glutamate-evoked current at all potentials and also reduced the non-TTX-sensitive component of voltage-dependent augmentation. The effects of TTX were identical whether or not NMDA channels were blocked. 4. We conclude that a persistent Na+ conductance exists in the apical dendrite of neocortical neurons. Together with the NMDA conductance at the synaptic site it provides a mechanism for the graded, voltage-dependent amplification of tonic, excitatory synaptic input. This amplification results in much more effective transmission of tonic excitatory current to the soma than would occur in a passive dendrite.},

	abstract = {(1) Action potentials and membrane currents were recorded in single myelinated rat nerve fibres at 20 and 37° C. Three experiments were also performed in single cat nerve fibres. (2) K currents were blocked by internal CsCl and external TEA. The steady state and kinetic parameters of Na activation and inactivation were determined at both temperatures. (3) When the temperature was raised from 20 to 37° C, steady state Na activation,m∞(V), and inactivation,h∞(V), did not change significantly. (4) The time constant of Na activation, τm, was determined within the potential range of −40 to 125 mV at 20° C andV=40–60 mV at 37° C. The temperature coefficient, Q10, of τm was 2.2. (5) The decay in the Na current was described by two exponentials at both temperatures. The amplitude of the slow phase was 1–10\%. The time constant of the fast phase of Na inactivation, τh1, was determined at both temperatures within the potential range of −50 mV to 125 mV. The Q10 of τh1 was 2.9 and did not depend on potential. (6) The Na equilibrium potential was 152 mV at 20° C and 144 mV at 37° C. The leakage conductance was 24 nS at 20° C and 43 nS at 37° C. These differences were interpreted as signs of fibre deterioration at higher temperature. (7) The results from the current and voltage clamp experiments performed in the cat nerve were essentially the same as those in the rat nerve fibres. (8) The action potentials computed on the basis of the voltage clamp results at 20° C were similar to the ones actually measured. This was also true for those action potentials predicted for 37° C on the basis of the 20° C data, thegL andVNa values measured at 37° C, and the Q10 values of the time constants. (9) Steady state values and kinetic parameters of K permeability were adopted from the literature. As in the experiments the influence ofPK on the shape of the predicted action potential was almost negligible at both temperatures.},

We here report patch-clamp recordings, both single- and multichannel, from acutely dissociated human axons. 2. Voltage-dependent sodium channels with a conductance gamma = 13 pS (measured in Ringer at room temperature) are found in the nodal area. 3. There are several types of voltage-dependent potassium channels: I channels (gamma = 34 pS), F channels (gamma = 50 pS), and channels with small conductance (gamma = 7-9 pS, all measured in high potassium solution). Most of them are closely similar to those already reported in Xenopus and rat axons; in addition a 200-pS, calcium-dependent potassium channel, similar to that in Xenopus, is present. 4. Differences between the electrical behavior of human axons and those of other species are probably not due to the presence of fundamentally different channel types, but may be due to differences in channel density or distribution. 5. As well as increasing our understanding of the basis of excitability in human nerve, this method may prove useful in the investigation of inherited and other human neuropathies.},

The validity of two of the assumptions of the cable model are evaluated, namely that the membrane potential be a function of the axial coordinate only and that the extracellular potential due to the presence of the nerve fiber be negligible. The membrane potential calculated from the passive steady-state cable model is compared with the membrane potential obtained from an analytical three-dimensional (3-D) volume conductor model of a nerve fiber. It is shown that for very small electrode-fiber distances (of only a few fiber radii), both assumptions are violated and the two models give quite different results. Over a wide range of the electrode-fiber distance (about 0.1 mm to 1 cm), both assumptions are fulfilled and the two models give approximately the same results. For very large distances (more than 10 cm, independent of fiber diameter) only the second assumption is satisfied, but a modification of the activating function of the cable model allows to calculate the membrane potential in agreement with the 3-D model.},

By appropriately adjusting the polarizing current conduction was not affected in most of the thin myelinated fibres (Group III) when all group II fibres were blocked. This selective action was achieved in 11 out of 15 experiments. Thus the method enables afferent volleys to be set up selectively in Group III fibres.2.Recording single unit action potentials from the nerve revealed that the Group II compound volley is a reliable indicator for the extent of the block. As a prerequisite for this finding it was established by unit analysis that temporal dispersion due to the polarizing current did not occur within both Groups II and III fibre populations.3.The membrane mechanism of the block was examined by testing the excitability changes in single fibres produced by the polarizing current. The findings indicate that the block was achieved by a membrane depolarization, causing inactivation of the sodium system.4.Asynchronous firing produced by the blocking current itself, known to be a disturbing factor in such experiments, was shown to be virtually absent during the block. Discharges in Group II fibres evoked by the initial rise of the depolarizing current were prevented from conditioning the CNS effects of the selective Group III volley by appropriately advancing the onset of the current.5.A complete and selective Group II block could also be performed during prolonged stimulation. In particular the method was shown to be able to ensure afferent activity being confined to small fibres during adequate stimulation of skin receptors.},

In particular, slow ({\textless}1–4 Hz) rhythms recorded in the hippocampus correlate with oscillatory behaviors in interneurons in this frequency range. Limiting the ion channels to the traditional Hodgkin–Huxley sodium and potassium currents, a persistent sodium current, and a slowly inactivating potassium current, we explore the role of slowly inactivating conductances in a multi-compartmental interneuronal model. We find a rich repertoire of tonic and bursting behaviors depending on the distribution, density and kinetics of this conductance. Specifically, burst frequencies of appropriate frequencies could be obtained for certain distributions and kinetics of this conductance. Robust (with respect to injected currents) regimes of tonic firing and bursting behaviors are uncovered. In addition, we find a bistable tonic firing pattern that depends on the slowly inactivating potassium current. Therefore, this work shows ways in which different channel distributions and heterogeneities could produce variable signal outputs. We suggest that an understanding of the dynamical profiles of inhibitory neurons based on the density and distribution of their currents is helpful in dissecting out the complex roles played by this heterogeneous group of cells.},

The volume of the extracellular space in the nodal gap, outside the nodal axolemma, increased linearly from less than 0.1 μm3 to about 0.6 μm3 with increasing fibre size. The Schwann cell membrane area facing the nodal gap outnumbered the membrane area of the nodal axon by 10–15 times in nerve fibres with aD value between 5 and μm.

Currents were classified by their sensitivity to 0.3 μm tetrodotoxin (TTX), electrophysiological properties and single-channel amplitude. Cells were classified according to the types of current recorded from them. 2 Type A cells expressed essentially pure TTX-sensitive (TTX-S) currents. Availability experiments with prepulse durations between 50 ms and 1 s gave a half-available voltage (Vh) of around -65 mV but the availability curves often had a complex shape, consistent with multiple inactivation processes. Measured inactivation time constants ranged from less than 1 ms to over 100 s, depending on the protocol used. 3 Cell types B and C each had, in addition to TTX-S currents, substantial and different TTX-resistant (TTX-R) currents that we have designated TTX-R1 and TTX-R2, respectively. TTX-R1 currents had a 1 s Vh of -29 mV, showed little 1 Hz use dependence at -67 mV and recovered from the inactivation induced by a 60 ms depolarizing pulse with time constants of 1.6 ms (91 \%) and 908 ms. They also exhibited slow inactivation processes with component time constants around 10 and 100 s. TTX-R2 currents activated and inactivated at more negative potentials (1 s Vh= -46 mV), showed substantial 1 Hz use dependence and had inactivation (60 ms pulse) recovery time constants at -67 mV of 3.3 ms (58 \%) and 902 ms. 4 Type D cells had little or no current in 0.3 μm TTX at a holding potential of -67 mV. Current amplitude increased on changing the holding potential to -107 mV. Type D cell currents had more hyperpolarized availability and I-V curves than even TTX-R2 currents and suggest the existence of TTX-R3 channels. 5 In outside-out patches with 250 mM external NaCl, the single-channel conductance (γ) of TTX-S channels was 19.5 pS and the potential for half-maximal activation (Va) was -45 mV. One population of TTX-R channels had a γ of 9.2 pS and a Va of -27 mV. A second population had a γ of 16.5 pS and a more negative Va of -42 mV. The latter population may underlie the type D cell current. 6 Small DRG cells express multiple Na+ currents with varied time constants and voltage dependences of activation and inactivation. Nociceptive cells still fire when chronically depolarized by an increased external K+ concentration. TTX-R1 and TTX-R2 Na+ channels may support that firing, while the range of inactivation time constants described here would increase the repertoire of DRG cell burst firing behaviour generally.},

Twenty subjects were examined twice. Both techniques yielded an equal DMCV and equally reproducible results. Group mean velocities for the slowest examined (MNCV95) motor nerve fibres were 39.0 m/sec (S.D. 3.3) for Ingram's technique and 38.6 (S.D. 3.6) for Hopf's technique. The conventional MNCV was always slower than the velocity of the 5\% fastest fibres estimated from the DMCV. Ingram's technique may have a number of merits which may have been obscured by measurement in the peroneal nerve, which may be of advantage in shorter nerve segments or faster nerve fibres. On the basis of our data in the peroneal nerve of healthy subjects no preference can be given for either of the techniques.},

	volume = {22},
	issn = {0278-940X},
	abstract = {Electric fields excite electrically active tissue by several mechanisms. A long, straight, uniform fiber is polarized by an activating function, proportional to the axial gradient of the axial electric field. During unipolar anodal stimulation, the activating function results in two areas of depolarization (virtual cathodes) that are responsible for anode-make stimulation. During unipolar cathodal stimulation, the virtual anodes can be exploited to produce unidirectional propagation and physiological recruitment of axons. Anode-break stimulation of nerves arises from the intrinsic properties of the sodium channel kinetics; cathode-break stimulation in nerves is anode-break stimulation at a virtual anode. The activating function applies to magnetic stimulation as well as to electric stimulation. Other important mechanisms of stimulation arise if the fiber is terminated, nonuniform, or curved. In the brain, cortical neurons are excited when the electric field is directed from the dendrites toward the axon. Possible mechanisms for cortical excitation are the impedance mismatch between the axon and dendritic tree, and the axon bending as it enters the white matter. Transcranial magnetic stimulation differs from transcranial electric stimulation because during magnetic stimulation the electric field is parallel to the brain surface, whereas during electric stimulation the electric field has components both parallel and perpendicular to the brain surface. Cardiac tissue can be represented by use of the bidomain model. This model predicts that a point-source stimulus results in adjacent areas of depolarized and hyperpolarized tissue. The presence of virtual anodes during cathodal stimulation is analogous to the creation of virtual anodes along a one-dimensional fiber by the activating function. Anode- and cathode-break stimulation both occur in cardiac tissue, but the mechanism may be different than for nerve and may depend on diffusion of depolarization into a previously hyperpolarized region. Electrical stimulation of cardiac tissue can cause reentry through a critical point mechanism. Two mechanisms for defibrillation have been hypothesized: (1) the relatively high junctional resistance between cardiac cells causes each cell to be depolarized on one side and hyperpolarized on the other; and (2) the fiber tracts within the heart behave like individual fibers, with fiber curvature providing a mechanism for polarization. Similarities among nerve, brain, and cardiac stimulation are emphasized.},

These data do not support the hypothesis that a primary disturbance of the motor neurons is responsible for the muscle changes in myotonic dystrophy. The reduction of the motor nerve conduction velocity, which was an inconstant finding, should not be considered an indication of a neurogenic aetiology of myotonic dystrophy, but only one of the many disorders of a multisystem disease.},

	abstract = {1. Potassium currents were measured in voltage-clamped single myelinated rat nerve fibres before and after paranodal demyelination with 0.2\% pronase or 0.2\% lysolecithin added to the external solution. Sodium currents were blocked by 300 nM-tetrodotoxin. For the purpose of comparison, intact frog nerve fibres were also investigated. 2. Our results suggest the existence of at least two distinct types of K+ channels in the intact node of Ranvier, one with slow and another with fast gating kinetics, in the ratio 4:1. 3. In the rat nodal membrane, slow K+ channels have voltage-dependent time constants of K+ deactivation with tau n = 68 ms at E = -105 mV and tau n = 26 ms at E = -150 mV at 20 degrees C. The activation curve of the slow K+ conductance is sigmoid with an inflexion point at -60 mV. This means that about 35\% of the slow K+ channels are in the open state at the resting potential of -77 mV. Slow K+ channels could be blocked by 10 mM-tetraethylammonium chloride, but were insensitive to 4-aminopyridine. 4. After paranodal demyelination the ratio of fast to slow K+ channels increased from 17 to 83\%. As in the frog (Dubois, 1981 alpha), the population of fast K+ channels in the rat may consist of two different subgroups, both of which can be blocked by 4-aminopyridine. 5. Demyelination was accompanied by an increase in the capacity current which was used to estimate the exposed membrane area. The density of slow and fast K+ channels was calculated from the quotient of the steady-state K+ conductance to membrane area. The density of the slow K+ channels is maximal in the nodal membrane and decreases to 1/31 in the internode. By contrast, the distribution of the fast K+ channels differs, their density being maximal in the paranode and decreasing to one-sixth in the node and internode.},

Extracellular stimulation of the three models is used to study their strength-duration and current0distance (I–X) relationships, conduction velocity (CV) and action potential shape. All three models have a chronaxie time that is within the experimental range.

Model C is able to produce a depolarising afterpotential (DAP), whereas models A and B exhibit hyperpolarising afterpotentials. Models A and B are determined to be the preferred models when low-frequency stimulation ({\textless}∼25Hz) is used, owing to their efficiency and accurate excitation and conduction properties.

The half-time for activation, the time constant for inactivation, and the midpoints of activation and inactivation of the third TTX-R Na+ currents are significantly different from those of Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 Na+ currents.

The Cd2+ sensitivity of third TTX-R Na+ current is closer to cardiac Na+ currents. A concentration of 1 mM Cd2+ is required to completely block this current, which is significantly lower than the 5 mM required to block Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 currents.

	abstract = {1 We investigated voltage-gated potassium channels in human peripheral myelinated axons; apart from the I, S and F channels already described in amphibian and rat axons, we identified at least two other channel types. 2 The I channel activated between -70 and -40 mV, and inactivated very slowly (time constant 13.1 s at -40 mV). It had two gating modes: the dominant (‘noisy’) mode had a conductance of 30 pS (inward current, symmetrical 155 mM K+) and a deactivation time constant (τ) of 25 ms (-80 mV); it accounted for most (≈50-75 \%) of the macroscopic K+ current in large patches. The secondary (‘flickery’) gating mode had a conductance of 22 pS, and showed bi-exponential deactivation (τ= 16 and 102 ms; -80 mV); it contributed part of the slow macroscopic K+ current. 3 The I channel current was blocked by 1 μM α-dendrotoxin (DTX); we also observed two other DTX-sensitive K+ channel types (40 pS and 25 pS). The S and F channels were not blocked by 1 μM DTX. 4 The conductance of the S channel was 7-10 pS, and it activated at slightly more negative potentials than the I channel; its deactivation was slow (τ= 41.7 ms at -100 mV). It contributed a second component of the slow macroscopic K+ current. 5 The F channel had a conductance of 50 pS; it activated at potentials between -40 and +40 mV, deactivated very rapidly (τ= 1.4 ms at -100 mV), and inactivated rapidly (τ= 62 ms at +80 mV). It accounted for the fast-deactivating macroscopic K+ current and partly for fast K+ current inactivation. 6 We conclude that human and rat axonal K+ channels are closely similar, but that the correspondence between K+ channel types and the macroscopic currents usually attributed to them is only partial. At least five channel types exist, and their characteristics overlap to a considerable extent.},

	abstract = {In the course of this study, 2 submodels have been developed and combined, the 2-D finite element modeling of the electrical potential distribution in the human thigh and a Hodgkin and Huxley (HH) type model to calculate fiber excitation and action potential propagation. To determine the excitation of the target muscle fiber with the help of the activating function, the fiber's orientation within the muscle has to be known. The electric field along the fiber has to be calculated as a function of the applied electric current and the potential at the electrodes, respectively. The excitement of the muscle fibers varies across a wide range depending on the active and passive membrane parameters and the intracellular and extracellular mediums. Persisting denervation leads to a decay of muscle cells, and a partial substitution by fibroblasts occurs. The electrical activation of these tissues is more difficult, and biphasic stimulation pulses up to 200 ms in duration and 60–100 V in amplitude are needed to cause a contraction of the denervated muscle. An example shows the field distribution and the simulated activity in one representative muscle fiber of a well trained m. rectus femoris.},

The analysis shows that: (i) in most cases, the origin of artificial excitation is within the axon and the soma is much more difficult to excite; (ii) within the central nervous system, positive and negative threshold currents essentially depend on the position and orientation of the neurons relative to the applied electric field; (iii) in several cases, stimulation with positive currents is easier; and (iv) it should be possible to excite synaptic activity without the generation of propagating action potentials.

	abstract = {Voltage-dependent persistent inward currents are thought to make an important contribution to the input–output properties of α−motoneurons, influencing both the transfer of synaptic current to the soma and the effects of that current on repetitive discharge. Recent studies have paid particular attention to the contribution of L-type calcium channels, which are thought to be widely distributed on both the somatic and the dendritic membrane. However, the relative contribution of different channel subtypes as well as their somatodendritic distribution may vary among motoneurons of different species, developmental stages, and motoneuron pools. In this study, we have characterized persistent inward currents in juvenile (10- to 24-day-old) rat hypoglossal (HG) motoneurons. Whole-cell, voltage-clamp recordings were made from the somata of visualized rat HG motoneurons in 300-μm brain stem slices. Slow (10 s), triangular voltage-clamp commands from a holding potential of −70 to 0 mV and back elicited whole-cell currents that were dominated by outward, potassium currents, but often showed a region of negative slope resistance on the rising phase of the command. In the presence of potassium channel blockers (internal cesium and external 4-aminopyridine and tetraethylammonium), net inward currents were present on both the rising and falling phases of the voltage-clamp command. A portion of the inward current present on the ascending phase of the command was mediated by TTX-sensitive sodium channels, whereas calcium channels mediated the remainder of the current. We found roughly the same relative contributions of P-, N-, and L-type channels to the calcium currents recorded at the soma that had previously been found in neonatal rat HG motoneurons. In most cells, the somatic voltage thresholds for calcium current onset and offset were similar and the peak current was largest on the ascending phase of the clamp command. However, about one-third of the cells exhibited a substantial clockwise current hysteresis, i.e., inward currents were present at lower voltages on the descending phase of the clamp command. In the same cells, 1-s depolarizing voltage-clamp commands were followed by prolonged tail currents, consistent with a prominent contribution from dendritic channels. In contrast to previous reports on turtle and mouse motoneurons, blocking L-type calcium channels did not eliminate these presumed dendritic currents.},

Many of these applications require the use of arrays of small electrodes. Stimulation through small electrodes is often painful, however, limiting the practicality of such arrays. The purpose of this study was to test a method for elevating the pain threshold to electrocutaneous stimulation through small (1-mm diameter) electrodes on the fingertip. We hypothesized that long, subthreshold, depolarizing prepulses (PP) would elevate the pain threshold so that a subsequent stimulus pulse (SP) would be less likely to be painful. We used psychophysical methods to measure the probability that an SP would be perceived as painful both by itself and when preceded by a PP that was 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 dB lower in amplitude than the SP. We found that the PPs significantly increased the pain threshold, reducing the likelihood that the SP was painful (p {\textless} .0001). The dose effect of PP amplitude was also highly significant (p {\textless} .0001), with larger PPs elevating pain thresholds more. To our knowledge, this is the first report of PPs being used to elevate electrical stimulation thresholds in humans. PPs may be useful for selective inactivation of neural subpopulations in many human neuroprosthetic applications.},

Motor nerve conduction studies (NCS) of the median, ulnar, and deep ulnar motor (DUM) nerves on 20 normal hands were performed using both traditional bipolar and experimental monopolar (referenced to the contralateral hand) montages. As the position of E2 was altered, the CMAP onset latency varied 0.1–0.5 ms for the median NCS, 0.1–0.3 ms for the ulnar NCS, and 0.1–1.5 ms for the DUM NCS. This study demonstrates that E2 recorded potentials are significant and vary with positioning, affecting motor onset latency.

The aim of the present work was to confirm this difference by determining the time constants for single sensory axons by using microneurography and for single motor axons by recording single motor units with bipolar concentric needle electrodes. To determine the influence of the conditioning pulse on the neural time constant, we used both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing conditioning pulses. When hyperpolarizing conditioning pulses at comparable intensity were applied, the tendency was to find shorter time constants than when depolarizing pulses were applied, although still with the motor time constant being slightly shorter. Although the absolute values varied with the different methods, the sensory time constant was generally three times the motor time constant for depolarizing conditioning stimuli, whereas for hyperpolarizing conditioning stimuli the difference dropped to about one and a half. These characteristics improve understanding of the behavior of sensory and motor axons, and, in particular, explain the differential excitability.

	abstract = {We have recently shown that stimulation, through a multi-electrode array, of thin nerve fibres close to the dermo-epidermal junction in the skin, produces powerful inhibition of itch and, to a lesser degree, cutaneous pain in humans. Here, we have studied the induction time and frequency dependency (range 1–10Hz) of the inhibitory effects of such stimulation on itch, mechanical, and thermal pain, in 20 healthy subjects. Sixteen electrodes applied on the skin were consecutively stimulated using a method termed cutaneous field stimulation (CFS). The results show that different treatment periods with CFS were required for the induction of significant inhibitory effects on different nociceptive qualities: 1st heat pain (1min), itch (3min), 2nd heat pain (6min), pinch evoked pain (8min). Six to ten minutes stimulation sufficed to induce peak inhibitory effects on all these sensory qualities while longer stimulation (up to 40min) did not cause significantly stronger inhibition. The effects on itch, 1st and 2nd heat pain lasted over 55min after termination of CFS. There was no effect on prickle. No significant difference in inhibitory effects of different stimulation frequencies (1, 4 and 10Hz/electrode) was found. The induction time and effective stimulation frequencies may suggest that the underlying mechanisms are similar to those of long term depression (LTD) previously described in the spinal cord in animal experiments.},

	abstract = {It is known that stimulation of thin cutaneous nerve fibers can induce long lasting analgesia through both supraspinal and segmental mechanisms, the latter often exhibiting restricted receptive fields. On this basis, we recently developed a new method, termed cutaneous field stimulation (CFS), for localized stimulation of Aδ and C fibers in the superficial part of the skin. In the present study, we have evaluated the effects of CFS on non-nociceptive and nociceptive skin senses. We compared the effects of CFS with those of conventional transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), known to preferentially activate coarse myelinated fibers. A battery of sensory tests were made on the right volar forearm of 20 healthy subjects. CFS (16 electrodes, 4 Hz per electrode, 1 ms, up to 0.8 mA) and TENS (100 Hz, 0.2 ms, up to 26 mA) applied either on the right volar forearm (homotopically), or on the lower right leg (heterotopically) were used as conditioning stimulation for 25 min. The tactile threshold was not affected by either homo- or heterotopical CFS or TENS. The mean thresholds for detecting warming or cooling of the skin were increased by 0.4–0.9°C after homo- but not heterotopical CFS and TENS. Regarding nociceptive skin senses, homo- but not heterotopical CFS, markedly reduced CO2-laser evoked Aδ- and C fiber mediated heat pain to 75 and 48\% of control, respectively, and mechanically evoked pain to 73\% of control. Fabric evoked prickle, was not affected by CFS. Neither homo- nor heterotopical TENS induced any marked analgesic effects. It is concluded that different qualities of nociception can be differentially controlled by CFS.},

	abstract = {Scratching the skin, while instantly relieving itch, often aggravates itch over time due to skin injury. To relieve itch, without damaging the skin, a new technique termed cutaneous field stimulation (CFS) was developed and tested on 21 subjects. CFS uses a flexible plate with needle-like electrodes (n=16) to electrically stimulate nerve fibres in the superficial skin. The electrodes were stimulated consecutively (4 Hz per electrode, pulse duration 1 ms, intensity 0.4–0.8 mA, 25 min). CFS resulted in a pricking and burning sensation that usually faded rather quickly. The burning sensation was still present during a selective block of impulse conduction in myelinated fibres indicating that nociceptive C-fibres are activated by CFS. Furthermore, a flare reaction developed around the CFS electrodes indicating activation of axon reflexes in nociceptive C-fibres. Itch, elicited by transdermal iontophoresis of histamine, was abolished within the skin area pre-treated with CFS, and was reduced to 14\% of control 10 cm distally. Contralateral effects were small or non-existent. After 4 h, itch was reduced ipsilaterally to 32\% of control. In comparison, 2 h after transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS; 10–20 mA, 100 Hz, 25 min) ipsilateral itch was reduced to 56\% of control. In conclusion, CFS offers a powerful new method for combating itch. It is suggested that CFS acts through endogenous central inhibitory mechanisms that are normally activated by scratching the skin.},

The “average” motor conduction velocity was 46.8±1.40 m/sec in the affected side and 50.4±1.44 m/sec in the unaffected side, with a statistically significant difference (P{\textless}0.01).

Prolonged conduction velocity in the hemiplegic side compared with the unaffected side was found in 76\% of patients when the “slow” motor conduction velocity was measured, in 16\% of patients each for the “average” motor and “fast” sensory conduction velocities, and in 4\% of patients for the “fast” motor conduction velocity. Direct injury of the nerve, and change in temperature could be ruled out as the cause of prolongation of the “slow” conduction velocity of the motor nerve fibers. Although the relation of these changes to muscle atrophy in patients with upper motor neuron lesions is not known, the findings indicate that upper motor neuron lesions affect the function of slowly-conducting fibers of the lower motor neuron.},

	abstract = {A new method for estimating the distribution of conduction velocities (DCV) of peripheral nerve fibers has been developed. It also enables estimation of single nerve fiber action potential (SFAP), which agrees with the physiological knowledge. Two compound nerve action potentials (CAPs) elicited by electrical stimulation of a nerve bundle were recorded at different conduction distances. The distances between the stimulation and recording electrodes were measured on the skin surface along the nerve bundle. Starting with an arbitrary SFAP, the first estimated DCV was calculated from a CAP by the regularized non-negative least squares method. The next SFAP was then calculated by deconvolution of the other CAP and the estimated DCV. A lowpass filter with an appropriate cutoff frequency was used to obtain better conversion. The process was iterated until the CAP error defined as {\textbar}CAPcalculated−CAP{\textbar}2 was small enough. The conduction distances contained errors in measurement, especially in the distal segment, that distorted the estimated results. The Fibonacci search, therefore, was adopted to optimize the distance according to the CAP error. The accuracy of this method was demonstrated by a simulation study performed with two CAPs calculated from an arbitrary bimodal DCV and a biphasic SFAP to which a Gaussian white noise was added. The reliability of this method was checked in normal subjects by recording a pair of CAPs elicited by stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist and the elbow.},

	abstract = {In a number of clinical studies, measurement of axonal strength–duration properties has been used to provide indirect insight into conductances at the node of Ranvier, particularly persistent Na+ conductance. However, the specificity of any changes is limited because other factors can affect strength–duration behavior. The present study was undertaken to define the relationship between different strength–duration measures at rest and at different membrane potentials, and also to determine the limits within which strength–duration behavior can be used as a measure of nodal conductances. The strength–duration time constant (τSD) and rheobase of 20 single motor units in the flexor carpi ulnaris were calculated from thresholds defined using threshold tracking. “True” rheobase and rheobasic latencies were measured using test stimuli of 100-ms duration. For ten units, the technique of latent addition was used to measure threshold changes directly attributable to nodal conductances, and for six units these were compared with strength–duration properties at different membrane potentials. The data indicate that measurements of τSD and rheobase can provide sensitive indicators of conductances present at the node of Ranvier when membrane potential changes. There is a reciprocal relationship between τSD and rheobase for single motor units at different membrane potentials, and this relationship may allow changes in τSD due to depolarization and demyelination to be differentiated. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

	abstract = {Paresthesias are common manifestations of central and peripheral pathological processes and are due to ectopic impulse activity in cutaneous afferents or their central projections. Cutaneous afferents are more excitable than motor axons, due to differences in their biophysical properties. These differences probably include more persistent Na+ conductance and inward rectification on cutaneous afferents, properties which probably confer greater protection from impulse-dependent conduction failure but create a greater tendency to ectopic activity. Ectopic discharges can be induced in normal afferents by four maneuvers: hyperventilation, ischemia, release of ischemia, and prolonged tetanization. The alkaline shift produced by hyperventilation selectively increases the persistent Na+ conductance, while the membrane depolarization produced by ischemia affects both transient and persistent Na+ channels. Postischemic and posttetanic paresthesias occur when hyperpolarization by the Na+/K+ pump is transiently prevented by raised extracellular K+. The electrochemical gradient for K+ is reversed, and inward K+ currents trigger regenerative depolarization. These mechanisms of paresthesia generation can account for paresthesias in normal subjects and may be relevant in some peripheral nerve disorders. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

	abstract = {Compared with control subjects, patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have been reported to experience less or no paresthesias during and after release of ischemic compression of the upper arm for 10 min. This is reminiscent of the resistance to ischemia of diabetic patients, in whom sensory and motor axons undergo less ischemic depolarization and less postischemic hyperpolarization than in control subjects. The present study compared the changes in axonal excitability produced by ischemia for 10 min in 21 patients with ALS and 14 age-matched control subjects. Fewer patients reported intraischemic or postischemic paresthesias and the intensity of paresthesias was less, but this was significant only for postischemic paresthesias. There were quantitatively similar changes in refractoriness, supernormality, and strength-duration time constant during ischemic compression, but the increase in excitability of motor axons was less during the second half of ischemia in the patients. After release of ischemia the postischemic hyperpolarization was greater in the ALS patients, the opposite of what occurs in diabetes. These changes could reflect reduced intraneural K+ accumulation due to loss of motor axons or an alteration in nerve metabolism or membrane properties. Either way, the present study has failed to confirm previous reports of “ischemic resistance” in ALS, and indicates that the changes in axonal properties in ALS are not analogous to those in diabetes mellitus. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

	abstract = {In normal subjects, the strength-duration time constant is longer for cutaneous afferents than for motor axons, probably because the former express a greater non-inactivating (persistent) Na+ conductance that is active at threshold. Using a threshold-tracking system the strength-duration properties of cutaneous afferents and motor axons were recorded from 23 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and compared with those of 32 healthy subjects. In control subjects and patients, the strength-duration time constant of sensory fibres declined with age, and there was no difference between the two groups when age was taken into account. The motor time constant did not change with age when expressed as a percentage of the time constant for sensory fibres in the same nerve, but was significantly longer for the patients than control subjects. In addition, motor rheobase was significantly lower for the patients, when expressed as a percentage of sensory rheobase. There was an inverse relationship between the time constant and rheobase for sensory and motor axons, and this was the same for the patients and the control subjects, suggesting that the variations in time constant within and between the groups were related to the expression of a common factor. Measurements of refractoriness and supernormality provided no evidence for a difference in resting membrane potential between the patients and control subjects. These findings are consistent with the interpretation that motor axons of the patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have a greater persistent Na+ conductance than normal motor axons. This could contribute to the ectopic activity responsible for fasciculation.},

	abstract = {This study was undertaken to compare the excitability changes of sensory and motor axons during hyperventilation and ischaemia, and to determine why ectopic impulse activity develops more readily during hyperventilation, and in sensory fibres. During hyperventilation for 20 min, all six subjects reported paraesthesiae in the hand and face, and four out of the six developed muscle twitching and cramps, associated with significant decreases of 20-30\% in the threshold current required to produce sensory and motor potentials of constant size. During ischaemia four out of the six subjects reported paraesthesiae, but none reported muscle twitching. There were significant decreases of 15-20\% in threshold for sensory and motor fibres. Ischaemia produced a marked decrease in supernormality, an increase in refractoriness and an increase in latency of the test compound sensory or motor potential, changes that were not seen with hyperventilation. The decrease in threshold during these manoeuvres was associated with a significant increase in strength--duration time constant (tau SD), indicating a relatively greater decrease in rheobase current. Using the technique of latent addition, we found that the changes in tau SD were consistent with a recently proposed model in which non-inactivating, voltage-dependent 'threshold channels' (presumably persistent Na+ channels) are active at resting potential. The failure of hyperventilation to alter conduction velocity, refractoriness or supernormality appreciably indicates that, unlike ischaemic depolarization, hyperventilation does not increase inactivation of conventional Na+ channels or activation of K+ channels, and this implies that the hyperventilation-induced increase in excitability is not the result of conventional depolarization, as seems to occur during ischaemia. These results suggest that hyperventilation has a rather selective action on the threshold channels, and they help to explain its greater effectiveness compared with ischaemia in provoking ectopic discharges. The greater expression of threshold channels in sensory than in motor fibres can explain why hyperventilation induces paraesthesiae before fasciculation and why only paraesthesiae occur during ischaemia.},

We hypothesized that because action potential initiation by extracellular stimulation occurs in the axons of central nervous system (CNS) neurons, the chronaxies and refractory periods determined using extracellular stimulation would be similar for cells and axons. Computer simulation was used to determine the sensitivity of chronaxie and refractory period to the neural element stimulated. The results demonstrate that chronaxies and refractory periods were dependent on the polarity of the extracellular stimulus and the electrode-to-neuron distance, and indicate that there is little systematic difference in either chronaxies or refractory periods between local cells or axons of passage with extracellular stimulation. This finding points out the difficulty in drawing conclusions regarding which neuronal elements are activated based on extracellular measurements of temporal excitation properties.},

Conduction velocity in the smaller and more slowly conducting fibers cannot be measured because the time of onset of their muscle action potential is hidden by the discharge of the faster units. With the available technique, therefore, conduction velocity of a peripheral nerve may, not infrequently, be within normal limits in the presence of clinical evidence of neuropathy, as long as some of the remaining fibers are of the fastest conducting type.A method of estimating the conduction velocity of the slowest as well as the fastest motor fibers has recently been described by Hopf.1 Differences of 4 to 7 meters per second were reported between the fast and slow fibers of the ulnar nerve in normal subjects.The method may provide a better insight into the motor},

	abstract = {We devised a method to assess the force–frequency relationship (FFR) in human skeletal muscle that involved delivery of a single 2.8-s train of shocks directly to the femoral nerve. This increasing-frequency train (IFT) was based on a power function, with a range of stimulation frequencies beginning at 5 Hz and rising to 100 Hz. We compared the IFT to a standard series of constant-frequency trains (CFT) under two conditions. Force–frequency curves were examined, first in response to altered muscle length and second, following fatigue. There was no leftward shift in the curve when the knee extensors were shortened, although maximal force increased. In contrast, we observed a rightward shift in the curve after fatigue with both protocols; the frequency required to develop 50\% of maximal force increased by 48\% (P {\textless} .01) with CFT and 58\% (P {\textless} .001) with an IFT. The CFT produced an irregular pattern of low-frequency fatigue recovery. In the IFT, low-frequency fatigue was greatest at the onset of recovery and decreased linearly until 120 s. These experiments show that the IFT protocol reveals alterations in muscle performance similar to the more traditional CFT. However, it requires only 2.8 s to administer and was judged more tolerable by 70\% of our subjects. This suggests that the IFT may be an effective alternative for determining the FFR in human muscle for clinical and experimental purposes. © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

Voluntary contractions at 20\% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and at 80\% MVC with duration of 20 s were performed at the beginning of each experiment. Tetanic electrical stimulation was then applied to the main muscle motor point for 20 s with surface electrodes at five stimulation frequencies (20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 Hz). All subjects showed myoelectric manifestations of muscle fatigue consisting of negative trends of spectral variables and conduction velocity and positive trends of amplitude variables. The main findings of this work are 1) myoelectric signal variables obtained from electrically elicited contractions show fluctuations smaller than those observed in voluntary contractions, 2) spectral variables are more sensitive to fatigue than conduction velocity and the average rectified value is more sensitive to fatigue than the root-mean-square value, 3) conduction velocity is not the only physiological factor affecting spectral variables, and 4) contractions elicited at supramaximal stimulation and frequencies greater than 30 Hz demonstrate myoelectric manifestations of muscle fatigue greater than those observed at 80\% MVC sustained for the same time.},

There is not, however, an adequate model for nerve excitation which allows one to compute the threshold of a nerve fiber for pulses of finite duration using electrodes that are not in direct contact with the fiber. This paper considers this problem and presents a model of the electrical properties of myelinated nerve which describes the time course of events following stimulus application up to the initiation of the action potential. The time-varying current and potential at all nodes can be computed from the model, and the strength-duration curve can be determined for arbitrary electrode geometries, although only the case of a monopolar electrode is considered in this paper. It is shown that even when the stimulus is a constant-current pulse, the membrane current at the nodes varies considerably with time. The strength-duration curve calculated from the model is consistent with previously published experimental data, and the model provides a quantitative relationship between threshold and fiber diameter which shows there is less selectivity among fibers of large diameter than those of small diameter.},

A space-clamped patch of neuronal membrane was modeled by a parallel nonlinear sodium conductance, linear leakage conductance, and membrane capacitance. Each parameter that governs the activation (m) and inactivation (h) variables of the sodium channel was varied from −50\% to +50\% of its default value, and for each variation a S-D relationship was generated. Individual changes in six of the eleven parameters (αmA, αmD, αhA, βmA, βmB, and βhB) generated substantial changes in the rheobase current and chronaxie time (Tch) of the model. Changing the parameter values individually did not correct for the model's failure to generate excitation after the release from a long duration hyperpolarization (anode break excitation). Scaling a combination of five parameters (αmA, αmB, αhA, βmA, and βhB) by an equal amount produced a model that generated anode break excitation and increased Tch, but also decreased the amplitude of the action potential. To reproduce the amplitude of the action potential, the maximum sodium conductance and sodium Nernst potential were increased. These modifications generated a model that had S-D properties closer to experimental results, could produce anode break excitation, and reproduced the action potential amplitude.},

	abstract = {To determine whether accommodation to depolarizing and hyperpolarizing stimuli differs for cutaneous afferents in the median and sural nerves, studies were performed in normal human subjects using threshold electrotonus.
            
            
              The changes in threshold for compound sensory action potentials of 50 \% of maximum were recorded when the nerves were subjected to long-lasting depolarizing and hyperpolarizing DC. The premise was that the threshold changes largely mirror the underlying electrotonic changes in membrane potential.
            
            
              The maximal threshold changes produced by depolarizing and hyperpolarizing currents were greater for median afferents, suggesting that the DC produced greater changes in membrane potential in these afferents.
            
            
              Median afferents underwent greater accommodation to depolarizing currents than sural afferents and a greater threshold undershoot at the end of the currents, suggesting greater activity of a slow K+ conductance. Median afferents also underwent greater accommodation to hyperpolarizing currents, suggesting greater inward rectification.
            
            
              These conductances are voltage dependent, and the differences in accommodation could be due to greater changes in membrane potential for the median nerve. The changes in threshold produced by long-lasting depolarizing and hyperpolarizing currents of graded intensity were therefore measured. When the threshold changes were matched for the two nerves, median afferents underwent 22.4 \% more accommodation to depolarizing currents and 28.7 \% more accommodation to hyperpolarizing currents.
            
            
              We conclude that there is greater expression of two internodally located conductances responsible for accommodation on median afferents. The biophysical differences identified in this study might contribute to the finding that sural afferents have a greater tendency to dysfunction than median afferents.},

A three-dimensional (3-D) volume conductor model of fascicles in a multigroove device and a model of myelinated nerve fiber stimulation were used to calculate threshold stimuli of nerve fibers in these fascicles. After their exposition, fascicles from rat sciatic nerve were positioned in different grooves of appropriate sizes and stimulated separately. The device appeared to be suitable for fascicle-selective stimulation, because both computer simulations and acute animal experiments showed that crosstalk between neighboring fascicles is not a problem, even when monopolar stimulation was used. The threshold stimulus was lower for a small fascicle than for a large one. When the amount of (conducting) medium between contact and perineurium or its conductivity was reduced, threshold stimuli were lower. Moreover, simulations predict that the slopes of recruitment curves are smaller and inverse recruitment order is less pronounced. Simulations also showed that a small contact is preferable to a large one, because a small contact gives a slightly smaller slope of the recruitment curve. Both experimentally and theoretically a significantly smaller slope of recruitment curves was obtained by stimulation with a cathode and an anode at opposite sides of the fascicle, driven by two current sources giving simultaneous pulses with different, but linearly dependent amplitudes.},

Dorsal root or dorsal column stimulation at levels subthreshold for the impaled axon elicited a prolonged depolarization corresponding to the primary afferent depolarization (PAD). The depolarization was preceded by a brief hyperpolarizing potential during which excitability was decreased. The hyperpolarization corresponds temporally to the extracellularly recorded DRP IV component of the dorsal root potential described by Lloyd and McIntyre17, and may represent the intracellular correlate of this potential. Possible mechanisms for this hyperpolarization include electrical interactions between neuronal elements, a biphasic GABA response, or attenuation of background afferent axonal depolarization.},

Here we report that a long-term increase in perceived pain to electrical test stimuli was induced by high-frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) (5 × 1 sec at 100 Hz) of peptidergic cutaneous afferents (27\% above baseline, undiminished for {\textgreater}3 hr). In contrast, a long-term decrease in perceived pain (27\% below baseline, undiminished for 1 hr) was induced by low-frequency stimulation (LFS) (17 min at 1 Hz). Pain testing with punctate mechanical probes (200 μm diameter) in skin adjacent to the HFS–LFS conditioning skin site revealed a marked twofold to threefold increase in pain sensitivity (secondary hyperalgesia, undiminished for {\textgreater}3 hr) after HFS but also a moderate secondary hyperalgesia (30\% above baseline) after strong LFS. Additionally, HFS but not LFS caused pain to light tactile stimuli in adjacent skin (allodynia). In summary, HFS and LFS stimulus protocols that induce LTP or LTD in spinal nociceptive pathways in animal experiments led to similar LTP- and LTD-like changes in human pain perception (long-term hyperalgesia or hypoalgesia) mediated by the conditioned pathway. Additionally, secondary hyperalgesia and allodynia in adjacent skin induced by the HFS protocol and, to a minor extent, also by the LFS protocol, suggested that these perceptual changes encompassed an LTP-like heterosynaptic facilitation of adjacent nociceptive pathways by a hitherto unknown mechanism.},

The final terminal segments of these nerves are the proper digital nerves. Ring recording electrodes are commonly used to detect the proper digital nerves' antidromic responses. Attempts to record the separate contributions of individual digital nerves along the lateral aspects of each finger, using small surface electrodes, is shown to be unreliable for determining the integrity of a single terminal digital branch. We found between 50\% to 77\% of the stimulated terminal branch's response amplitude when recorded at electrodes positioned over the nonstimulated branch located 180° from the activated terminal branch. Detecting a single terminal nerve response was achieved by using the fourth digit and the second digit with one of the second digit's branches neurophysiologically blocked by local anesthetic. The volume-conducted response from the opposite side of the finger resulted in this relatively large recorded response, which remains within the range of reference values precluding the simple use of antidromic techniques to assess injury to a single proper digital nerve. Techniques are proposed to avoid such pitfalls and to assess most accurately the desired response. © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Muscle Nerve 24: 1489–1495, 2001},

	abstract = {This report reviews the fundamental principles and the changing concepts of nerve stimulation techniques, and discusses the proper application of these techniques in the differential diagnosis of peripheral nerve disorders. Nerve conduction studies help delineate the extent and distribution of the neural lesion and distinguish two major categories of peripheral nerve disease: demyelination and axonal degeneration. Although the method is based on simple principles, pitfalls abound in practice. Variability in nerve conduction measurement may result from temperature change, variations among nerve segments, and the effects of age. Other sources of error include excessive spread of stimulation current, anomalous innervation, temporal dispersion, and inaccuracy of surface measurement. Unlike a bipolar dervation, which selectively records near-field potentials, a referential recording may give rise to stationary far-field peaks from a moving source. Overlooking this possibility can lead to an incorrect interpretation of findings. Conventional nerve conduction studies deal primarily with measurements of the distal nerve segments in an extremity. More recent techniques are applicable to less accessible anatomical regions, as illustrated by elicitation of the blink reflex, F wave, and H reflex, and the use of the inching technique. Other methods used to assess special aspects of nerve conduction include the ischemic test and studies of slow-conducting fibers.},

Late Na+ currents maintained throughout long-duration voltage-clamp steps (≥200 ms) were of two types: a low-threshold, tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX-s) current that was largely blocked by 200 nM TTX, and a high-threshold, TTX-resistant (TTX-r) current. TTX-s late current was found in approximately 28\% (10/36) of small-diameter neurons and was recorded only in neurons exhibiting TTX-s transient current. TTX-s transient current activation/inactivation gating overlap existed over a narrow potential range, centered between −30 and −40 mV, whereas late current operated over a wider range. The kinetics associated with de-inactivation of TTX-s late current were slow (τ approximately 37 ms at −50 mV), strongly suggesting that different subpopulations of TTX-s channel generate transient and late current. High-threshold TTX-r late current was only present in neurons generating TTX-r transient current. TTX-r late current operated over the same potential range as that for TTX-r transient current activation/inactivation gating overlap, and activation/inactivation gating overlap could be measured even after 1.5-s-duration pre-pulses. We suggest that TTX-s late sodium current results from channel openings different from those generating transient current. As in large-diameter sensory neurons, TTX-s channels generating late openings may play a key role in controlling membrane excitability. In contrast, a single population of high-threshold TTX-r channels may account for both transient and late TTX-r currents.},

Stimulus–response behaviour, strength–duration time constant, threshold electrotonus, current–threshold relationship and recovery cycle (refractoriness, superexcitability and late subexcitability) were recorded using a recently described protocol. In six patients, sequential studies were performed before, during and after haemodialysis. All patients underwent standard electrolyte and renal function tests before and after haemodialysis. Before dialysis, there were significant abnormalities in axonal excitability: reduced superexcitability; increased accommodation to depolarizing and hyperpolarizing currents; and a steeper current–threshold relationship compared with normal controls. These excitability parameters are the most sensitive to membrane potential and the abnormalities, which were all reduced by haemodialysis, closely resembled those in normal axons depolarized by ischaemia. Before dialysis, the excitability parameters correlated significantly with serum potassium (range 4.3–6.1 mM), but not with other markers of renal dysfunction: patients with normal axonal resting potentials had normal serum potassium, although urea and creatinine were elevated. We conclude that nerves are depolarized in many CRF patients and that the depolarization is primarily due to hyperkalaemia.},

Six patients were selected, all with evidence of distal focal motor conduction block involving the median nerve in the forearm. In all patients, the median nerve was stimulated at the wrist, just distal to the site of block, and the resulting compound muscle action potentials were recorded from abductor pollicis brevis. Stimulus–response behaviour, the strength–duration time constant, threshold electrotonus to 100 ms polarizing currents, a current–threshold relationship and the recovery of excitability following supramaximal activation were recorded using a protocol described recently. When compared with control values, patients demonstrated significantly greater superexcitability, a ‘fanning out’ of threshold electrotonus recordings, and a significant change in the slope of the current–threshold relationship. These abnormalities in axonal membrane excitability parameters closely resembled those in normal axons hyperpolarized following release from ischaemia. To test for axonal hyperpolarization, DC depolarizing currents were applied to the nerves of three patients, and all the excitability parameters were normalized by depolarization. Attempts to trace excitability measures proximally towards the site of block were unsuccessful, as the nerve became inexcitable in all cases. It is suggested that the distal hyperpolarization is probably linked to focal depolarization and that the clinical features of MMN are consistent with a depolarizing/hyperpolarizing lesion.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES Measures of nerve excitability provide information about biophysical properties of peripheral axons in disease states. One measure, the strength duration time constant (τSD), was previously reported to be prolonged in motor axons of patients with acquired neuromyotonia. The present study used a new protocol that applies a more comprehensive and sensitive panel of measures of axonal excitability, to determine firstly whether changes in τSD were present in a group of patients with evidence of spontaneous motor unit activity; and secondly, if such changes in τSD were present, whether other parameters of axonal excitability were affected, to clarify the mechanism of the change in τSD.
METHODS Eleven patients with both symptoms and EMG evidence of spontaneous motor unit activity were studied. Eight patients had autoimmune associated acquired neuromyotonia (aNMT) and three had the cramp fasciculation syndrome. The protocol first measured stimulus-response behaviour using two stimulus durations (from which the distribution of strength-duration time constants was estimated), and then threshold tracking was used to determine threshold electrotonus to 100 ms polarising currents, a current-threshold relation (indicating inward and outward rectification), and the recovery of excitability after supramaximal activation.
RESULTS The results were compared with previously published normal data. The value for τSD of motor axons in the patient group was 0.43 (0.02) ms (mean (SEM)), identical with the control value. Most other indices of axonal excitability, including those dependent on fast potassium channels, were also found to be normal. When compared with age matched controls however, the patients with acquired neuromyotonia had significantly greater late subexcitability after an impulse, greater excitability overshoots after depolarisation or hyperpolarisation, and more accommodation.
CONCLUSIONS No clear evidence for the mechanism of ectopic discharge in these patients was obtained, probably because the activity was generated focally, and most often at the motor nerve terminals. The unexpected finding of increased excitability overshoots and accommodation compared with age matched controls, suggests a relative up regulation of slow potassium conductance, possibly as a consequence of the continuous motor unit activity.},

	abstract = {The effects of temperature on parameters of motor nerve excitability were investigated in 10 healthy human subjects. The median nerve was stimulated at the wrist and compound muscle action potentials were recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis. Multiple excitability measures were recorded: stimulus–response curves, the strength–duration time constant (τSD), threshold electrotonus, a current–threshold relationship and the recovery of excitability following supramaximal activation. Recordings were made at wrist temperatures of 35, 32 and 29°C by immersing the arm proximal to the wrist in a water-bath. Cooling increased the relative refractory period by 7.8\% per degree C (P \&lt; 0.0001), slowed the accommodation to depolarizing currents by 4.0\% per degree C (P \&lt; 0.0001) and increased τSD by 2.6\% per degree C (P \&lt; 0.01), but most other excitability parameters were not affected significantly. The effects of temperature on threshold electrotonus were investigated further in separate studies on two subjects over the range 28–36°C and found to be complex. Whereas the rate of accommodation to depolarizing current was closely related to instantaneous temperature, the threshold increase induced by hyperpolarizing current was most sensitive to changes in temperature, probably because warming the nerve causes a transient hyperpolarization by accelerating the electrogenic sodium pump. Consequently, it may be preferable to make allowances for differences in skin temperature when testing patients for abnormal excitability parameters, rather than to change the temperature to a standard value. For most excitability parameters, however, temperature control is not as important as it is for conduction velocity measurements.},

	abstract = {Multiple nerve excitability measurements have been proposed for clinical testing of nerve function, since excitability measures can provide evidence of altered axonal membrane properties and are complementary to conventional nerve conduction studies. An important determinant of excitability is membrane potential, and this study was undertaken to determine the changes in a range of excitability properties associated with alterations in membrane potential. Membrane potential was varied directly using DC polarizing currents and indirectly by ischaemia. The median nerve was stimulated at the wrist and the resultant compound muscle action potentials recorded from abductor pollicis brevis. Stimulus–response behaviour, strength–duration time constant (τSD), threshold electrotonus to 100-ms polarizing currents, a current–threshold relationship and the recovery of excitability following supramaximal activation were each followed in four normal subjects during the two manoeuvres, using a recently described protocol. Membrane depolarization and ischaemia produced an increase in axonal excitability, an increase in the slope of the current–threshold relationship, a `fanning in' of responses during threshold electrotonus, a decrease in super-excitability, and increases in both τSD and the refractory period. Changes in the opposite direction occurred with membrane hyperpolarization and during the post-ischaemic period. One excitability parameter differentiated between the direct and indirect changes in membrane potential: late subexcitability was sensitive to polarizing currents but relatively insensitive to ischaemia, probably because of compensatory changes in extracellular potassium ions. These results should enable multiple excitability measurements to be used as a tool to identify changes in axonal membrane potential in neuropathy.},

Such information cannot be obtained from conventional nerve conduction studies. This article describes a new method that enables several such measurements to be made on a motor nerve quickly and reproducibly, with minimal operator intervention.

	abstract = {Wrist extension was performed in six healthy subjects to establish, first, whether it would be sufficient to produce conduction block and, secondly, whether the excitability changes associated with this manoeuvre are similar to those produced by focal nerve compression. During maintained wrist extension to 90°, all subjects developed conduction block in cutaneous afferents distal to the wrist, with a marked reduction in amplitude of the maximal potential by \&gt;50\%. This was associated with changes in axonal excitability at the wrist: a prolongation in latency, a decrease in supernormality and an increase in refractoriness. These changes indicate axonal depolarization. Similar studies were then performed in seven patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. The patients developed conduction block, again with evidence of axonal depolarization prior to block. Mild paraesthesiae were reported by all subjects (normals and patients) during wrist extension, and more intense paraesthesiae were reported following the release of wrist extension. In separate experiments, conduction block was produced by ischaemic compression, but its development could not be altered by hyperpolarizing currents. It is concluded that wrist extension produces a `depolarization' block in both normal subjects and patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, much as occurs with ischaemic compression, but that this block cannot be altered merely by compensating for the axonal depolarization. It is argued that conduction slowing need not always be attributed to disturbed myelination, and that ischaemic compression may be sufficient to explain some of the intermittent symptoms and electrodiagnostic findings in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, particularly when it is of mild or moderate severity.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Prior clinical work showed that electrical stimulation therapy with exponential current is able to slow down atrophy and maintain the muscle during nonpermanent flaccid paralysis. However, exponential currents are not sufficient for long-term therapy of denervated degenerated muscles (DDMs). We initiated a European research project investigating the rehabilitation strategies in humans, but also studying the underlying basic scientific knowledge of muscle regeneration from satellite cells or myoblast activity in animal experiments. In our prior study, we were able to show that high-intensity stimulation of DDMs is possible. At the beginning of training, only single muscle twitches can be elicited by biphasic pulses with durations of 120–150 ms. Later, tetanic contraction of the muscle with special stimulation parameters (pulse duration of 30–50 ms, stimulation frequency of 16–25 Hz, pulse amplitudes of up to 250 mA) can improve the structural and metabolic state of the DDMs. Because there are no nerve endings for conduction of stimuli, large-size, anatomically shaped electrodes are used. This ensures an even contraction of the whole muscle. Contrary to the current clinical knowledge, we were able to stimulate and train denervated muscle 15–20 years after denervation. The estimated amount of muscle fibers that have to be restored is about 2–4 million fibers in each m. quadriceps. To rebuild such a large number of muscle fibers takes up to 3–4 years. Despite constant stimulation parameters and training protocols, there is a high variation in the developed contraction force and fatigue resistance of the muscle during the first years of functional electrical stimulation.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to assess changes in body perception when visual feedback was removed from the hand and arm with the purpose of resembling the visual deprivation arising from amputation. The illusion was created by removing the visual feedback from the participants’ own left forearm using a mixed reality (MR) and green screen environment. Thirty healthy persons (15 female) participated in the study. Each subject experienced two MR conditions, one with and one without visual feedback from the left hand, and a baseline condition with normal vision of the limb (no MR). Body perception was assessed using proprioceptive drift, questionnaires on body perception, and thermal sensitivity measures (cold, warm, heat pain and cold pain detection thresholds). The proprioceptive drift showed a significant shift of the tip of the index finger (p{\textless}0.001) towards the elbow in the illusion condition (mean drift: −3.71 cm). Self-report showed a significant decrease in ownership (p{\textless}0.001), shift in perceptual distortions, (e.g. “It feels as if my lower arm has become shorter”) (p=0.025), and changes in sensations of the hand (tingling, tickling) (p=0.025). A significant decrease was also observed in cold detection threshold (p{\textless}0.001), i.e. the detection threshold was cooler than for the control conditions. The proprioceptive drift together with the self-reported questionnaire showed that the participants felt a proximal retraction of their limb, resembling the telescoping experienced by phantom limb patients. The study highlights the influence of missing visual feedback and its possible contribution to phantom limb phenomena.},

	abstract = {Changes in excitability of the sensorimotor cortex have been demonstrated in clinical musculoskeletal pain, although the timing is unknown. Eccentric exercise provokes delayed-onset muscle soreness providing a model to study the temporal profile of sensorimotor cortical plasticity during progressively developing muscle soreness. Twelve healthy participants performed eccentric exercise of the wrist extensors. Likert pain scores, pressure pain thresholds at the extensor carpi radialis (ECR) muscle, somatosensory evoked potentials from electrical stimulation of the radial nerve, maximal wrist extension force, and ECR motor evoked potentials to transcranial magnetic stimulation were recorded before (baseline) and at 2 hours (2-h post), 2 days (day 2), and 6 days (day 6) after exercise. Compared with baseline, 1) the Likert pain score was increased at 2-h post and increased further at day 2 (P {\textless} .01); 2) the ECR pressure pain thresholds were decreased at day 2 (P {\textless} .001); 3) the P45 amplitude of the somatosensory evoked potential from central-parietal recording sites was increased at day 2 (P {\textless} .001); 4) maximal wrist extension force was reduced 2-h post and at day 2 (P {\textless} .002); and 5) the cortical area from which ECR motor evoked potentials could be elicited was reduced at 2-h post and at day 2 (P {\textless} .03). A decrease in the ECR pressure pain thresholds was correlated (P {\textless} .027) with an increase in the P45 amplitude at a centroparietal recording site.
Perspective
These novel data demonstrate that the somatosensory cortical excitability may be affected by muscle soreness developing over days in parallel with a deficit in the motor system. Cortical neuroplasticity may thus develop in the subacute phase and be relevant for understanding neural adaptation in the transition from acute to persistent pain.},

	abstract = {The use of electrical stimulation for denervated muscles is still considered to be a controversial issue by many rehabilitation facilities and medical professionals because prior clinical experience has shown that treating denervated muscle tissue using exponential current over a long time period constitutes an impossible task. Despite this fact, we managed to evoke tetanic contractions in denervated muscle using a long duration stimulation with anatomically shaped electrodes and sufficiently high amplitudes. The pulse amplitudes, which were being used for this purpose, exceeded by far the MED-GV and EC regulations (300 mJ/impulse). For this reason, an application has recently been submitted to have the EC regulations changed accordingly. It takes a tetanic contraction to achieve the desired muscle fiber tension, constituting a hypertrophic stimulus. It is also an appropriate means of exercise, which is capable of creating the metabolic and structural conditions needed (e.g, increased mitochondrial volume and capillary density) to obtain satisfactory muscle performance. With patients suffering from a complete spinal cord injury at level D12/L1, having motor and sensory loss in both lower extremities, we were able to train denervated muscle using long-duration stimulation, evoking single muscle contractions at first, soon followed by tetanic contractions against gravity. To increase the efficacy of this functional electrical stimulation (FES) strengthening program, we used ankle weights. With daily FES training over a period of 1-2 years, denervated muscle was exercised until it produced torques between 16 and 38 Nm in the m. quadriceps. With that muscle force, it is possible to stand up from a sitting position in parallel bars. Our results show that denervated muscle in humans is indeed trainable and can perform functional activities with FES. Furthermore, this method of stimulation can assist in decubitus prevention and significantly improve the mobility of paraplegics.},

The study was restricted to a motor unit population simulating a hand muscle whose potentials were recorded on the skin over the muscle. Peak-to-peak amplitude and area of the evoked potential were calculated from the summed motor unit potentials and compared across conditions that simulated variation in different motor unit properties. The simulations involved varying the number of activated motor units, muscle fiber conduction velocities, axonal conduction velocities, neuronal activation times, the shape of the intracellular action potential, and recording configurations commonly used over hand muscles. The results obtained for the default condition simulated in this study indicated that {\textasciitilde}7\% of the motor unit potentials were responsible for 50\% of the size of the evoked potential. Variation in the amplitude and area of the evoked muscle potential was directly related to the number of active motor units only when the stimulus activated motor units randomly, and not when activation was based on a parameter such as motor unit size. Independent adjustments in motor unit properties had variable effects on the size of the evoked muscle potential, including when the stimulus activated only a subpopulation of motor units. These results provide reference information that can be used to assist in the interpretation of experimentally observed changes in the size of evoked muscle potentials.},

	abstract = {Patients with multifocal motor neuropathy may complain of muscle fatigue, even though the degree of conduction block assessed at rest has improved with treatment. To explore the mechanism involved, we examined changes in muscle force during maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and monitored conduction block before and after MVC in five patients with multifocal motor neuropathy. The results were compared with those for the contralateral unaffected homonymous muscles. For one patient, who had bilateral involvement, a normal subject of a similar age and stature served as the control. Results of conduction studies were also compared with those from six patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with similar compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes after proximal stimulation. During MVC for 60 s, the affected muscles developed prominent fatigue; the force at the end of contraction compared with the initial force was significantly lower for the affected muscles [42 ± 19\% (mean ± standard deviation) of the initial force] than for the control muscles (94 ± 9\%; P = 0.01). After MVC, the amplitude ratio of CMAPs after proximal versus distal nerve stimulation transiently decreased to 19 ± 14\% of that before MVC in the affected muscles, but not in the control muscles (94 ± 3.8\% of that before MVC) and in patients with ALS (95 ± 6.7\%). In one patient with a focal lesion in the forearm, nerve excitability was monitored at the lesion site before and after MVC for 120 s. There were significant increases in axonal threshold ({\textasciitilde}48\%) and supernormality ({\textasciitilde}135\%) immediately after MVC, suggesting that the axonal membrane had undergone hyperpolarization and, by extrapolation, that this had precipitated the conduction block. This study is the first to show that activity-dependent conduction block plays a role in human disease by causing muscle fatigue.},

	abstract = {Electrodiagnostic studies comprising electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS) are well-established objective methods for the diagnosis, quantification and classification of polyneuropathies (PNP). This paper reviews examination techniques, their pathophysiological interpretation, examination strategies and diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis and classification of a PNP. The routine electrodiagnostic evaluation includes sensory NCSs performed with surface or needle electrodes, motor NCSs, F-wave studies and EMG by qualitative or quantitative techniques. Sensory NCSs and F-wave studies have a high sensitivity in PNPs and the different techniques complement each other. The distinction between a PNP with predominantly axonal loss and a PNP with predominantly demyelination is one of the major aims of the electrophysiological examination. There are, however, large variation in suggested criteria for predominantly demyelination. The degree of slowing in conduction taken to indicate demyelination varies between a decrease of 50 to 30\% from mean of controls, distal latency prolongation criteria vary from 35\% to 70\% of mean of controls, F-wave latency prolongation criteria vary from 120\% to 150\% of upper limit of controls, and criteria for partial motor conduction block vary from 11 to 50\% reduction of CMAP amplitude and/or area between proximal and distal stimulation. Needle EMG studies may be valuable in order to detect and quantify denervation activity, to assess chronicity by an evaluation of the extent of reinnervation, and to evaluate the topographical distribution of changes. It is concluded that electrodiagnostic studies are valuable in patients with suspected PNP and the results may have consequences for prognosis and therapy of individual patients. Large variation in examination techniques, strategies, interpretations and diagnostic criteria have been found among electromyographers and it is suggested that the value of electrodiagnostic studies may be further improved by international standardisation.
Résumé
Les études électrophysiologiques comprenant un électromyogramme (EMG) et la mesure de la conduction nerveuse sont des méthodes bien établies pour le diagnostic, la quantification et la classification des polyneuropathies (PNP). Cet article passe en revue les techniques d’examen, leur interprétation physiopathologique, les stratégies d’examen et les critères utilisés pour le diagnostic et la classification des PNP. Les examens de routine comprennent la mesure de la conduction nerveuse sensorielle à l’aide d’électrodes de surface ou d’électrodes-aiguilles, la mesure de la conduction nerveuse motrice, l’étude de l’onde F et celle de l’EMG à l’aide de techniques qualitatives et quantitatives. La distinction entre PNP avec prédominance de la perte axonale et PNP avec prédominance de la démyélinisation est l’un des principaux buts de l’examen électrophysiologique. Il y a cependant de grandes variations dans les critères suggérant une prédominance de la démyélinisation. Le degré de ralentissement de la conduction nerveuse pris comme critère de démyélinisation correspond à une diminution de 50 à 30 \% de la moyenne des valeurs témoins ; la prolongation de la latence distale correspond, quant à elle, à une variation de 35 à 70 \% de la moyenne des valeurs témoins ; la prolongation de la latence correspond à une variation de 120 à 150 \% de la limite supérieure des valeurs témoins ; et les critères indiquant un bloc de conduction mtorice correspondent à une réduction de 11 à 50 \% de la moyenne de l’amplitude du CMAP et/ou de l’aire située entre la stimulation proximale et la stimulation distale. L’EMG par électrode-aiguille se révèle être un outil puissant dans la détection et la quantification de l’activité de dénervation, dans la détermination de la chronicité par évaluation de l’étendue de la réinnervation et dans l’évaluation de la distribution topographique des modifications. L’étude électrophysiologique est donc très utile chez les patients chez lesquels on suspecte une PNP. Ses résultats ne sont pas sans conséquence sur le pronostic et le traitement des patients. De grandes variations dans les techniques d’examen, les stratégies, l’interprétation et les critères diagnostiques ont été trouvées entre les différents électromyographistes. La puissance des études électrodiagnostiques pourrait donc être améliorée à travers une standardisation des méthodes au niveau international.},

	abstract = {The tibialis anterior (TA) is a muscle activated mainly during walking. Its use during the step cycle was studied in 10 patients (55.8 ± 8.8 years) with chronic hemiplegia (duration 3–18 years) and related to the muscle fibre composition, size and expression of isoforms of myosin heavy chains (MHCs). In the average step cycle the integrated surface EMG of the paralysed TA did in the majority of the hemiplegic patients not exceed 10\% of that recorded during maximal contraction of the normal leg. The type I fibre percentage in the paralysed TA subject was 57.4\% as compared with 79.4\% in normal muscles (P {\textless} 0.05). The range of axonal conduction velocities in the peroneal nerve did not differ in paralysed and non-paralysed leg, suggesting that there was no selective loss of one class of motoneurons. The type II fibres consisted of IIA (66\%) and IIB (31\%), in contrast to the normal TA muscle where less than 1\% of the muscle fibres are of type IIB. The incidence of fibres in the biopsies with both slow and fast MHCs had a mean value of 3.5\% (range 0.7–9\%). The type I and type II muscle fibres had normal sizes with cross-sectional area 4511 ± 962 μm2 and 6181 ± 1062 μm2. No selective type II atrophy was seen. Occasional hypertrophic type I and II fibres were seen in 4 patients. The findings indicate that mainly the low threshold motor units are active in the hemiplegic patients and suggest that the selective disuse of high threshold motor units predisposes for a transformation from type I to type II fibres with the occurrence of type IIB fibres.},

We evaluated the activated fibers by epidermal stimulation by assessing the conduction velocity (CV) of the peripheral nerves. The EPs were recorded from Cz electrode (vertex) of the International 10–20 system in 12 healthy subjects. For the ES, the tip of a stainless steel needle electrode was inserted in the epidermis of the skin (0.2mm in depth). Distal and proximal sites of the upper limb were stimulated by the LS and ES with an intensity which induced a definite pain sensation. Similar sites were stimulated by TS with an intensity of two times the sensory threshold. A major EP positive response (P1) was obtained by stimulation by all three types of stimuli. The P1 latency for the TS (245±22ms) was significantly shorter than that for the ES (302±17ms, P{\textless}0.0001) and LS (341±21ms, P{\textless}0.0001) and the peak latency P1 by the LS was also significantly longer, approximately 40ms, than that by the ES (P{\textless}0.0001). The CVs were 15.1, 15.3 and 44.1m/s obtained by ES, LS and TS, respectively. The CV indicated that the fibers activated by the ES were mainly Aδ fibers, which corresponded to the fibers stimulated by the LS. We considered that the ES with our newly developed needle electrode was a very convenient method for the selective stimulation of the Aδ fibers, since it was very simple, not requiring any special apparatus, did not cause bleeding or burns and caused minimum uncomfortable feeling.},

	abstract = {Abstract: In recent years various studies proved that electrical stimulation can improve contractile capability and restore muscle function in long-term denervated degenerated muscles. The low excitability of the muscle cells at the initial stage of training and surrounding connective tissue, acting as an electrical shunt, require special stimulation parameters. Until now, no appropriate devices (stimulators) are commercially available. Therefore, we were forced to design our own stimulators. The control unit of the stimulators is based on a microprocessor for maximum flexibility regarding the generation of the parameters such as pulse amplitudes, pulse width, frequency, stimulation times, ramps, and so on. In addition, the microprocessor design allows recording of compliance data such as stimulation date, time, duration, and used programs. The constant voltage output stage of the stimulator is able to generate biphasic charge balanced stimulation impulses with a pulse width of 1 to 300 ms, voltage amplitudes up to ±80 V (160 VPP), and stimulation currents up to 250 mA. To prevent direct current due to inexact charge compensation, the electrode outputs are decoupled capacitively. Simultaneous 2 channel stimulation with independent intensity levels is possible. The stimulators are programmed using a notebook or a personal digital assistant via infrared serial interface. This concept guarantees the application of correct stimulation parameters because the patient has only access to parameters that are preprogrammed for him in the outpatient clinic. For the home based training, access is limited to variation of intensity within preprogrammed limits. For safety reasons, the portable unit is powered by an internal rechargeable battery. High efficiency switched voltage regulators are used to provide the different required voltage levels while ensuring an acceptable operating time of the stimulator.},

        Measurement of the maximal (Vmax) and minimal (Vmin) motor nerve conduction velocities was performed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), bulbospinal muscular atrophy (BSMA), and control subjects. The collision method as described initially by Harayama and coworkers was used. This allowed for the correction of the velocity recovery effect (VRE) in Hopf’s original method. The purpose of this study is to clarify the controversial results regarding the Vmin and the difference between Vmax and Vmin (Vmax–Vmin) in ALS and to compare these results with BSMA, and clarify the usefulness of Harayama’s method. In ALS, a reduction of Vmax and Vmin, and an increase of Vmax–Vmin were found in both median and posterior tibial nerve. In BSMA, a reduction of Vmin and an increase of Vmax–Vmin in the median nerve were noted. Some patients whose results of conventional nerve conduction study were entirely within normal range showed abnormal results in Vmin and/or Vmax–Vmin. These results suggest that the correction of VRE is essential to determine a Vmin, and motor fibers with abnormally slow conduction velocities were present in ALS and BSMA. Harayama’s collision method is useful to detect abnormalities of motor fibers with submaximal conduction velocities.},

	abstract = {When an electric current is passed through a living excitable tissue it changes the “condition” of the tissue in such a way that, if the change be in the right direction and great enough, excitation results. The “condition” is, as yet, of unknown nature: it may be an electrical potential difference: it may be an ionic concentration difference: various guesses at it have been made, but further evidence, and evidence of a more specific kind than that ordinarily considered in the theory of electric excitation, is required before a decision can be reached. The “condition,” however, has many analogies with a potential in the ordinary physical sense. It will be referred to as the “local potential” V of the excitable tissue: Keith Lucas (e. g., 1910) called it the “excitatory disturbance”: when we know better what it is, we can perhaps give it a better name. It will be denoted in general by V, and the resting value of V will be called V0. When a current is passed into an excitable tissue V is raised at the cathode, lowered at the anode: if V is raised enough, a state of instability is reached and “excitation” occurs. In a recent preliminary treatment of this subject (Hill, 1935, b) the name “cathode potential” was used. It was not realized at first that excitation at break of constant current fits into the scheme just as well as excitation at make: so that the anode must be considered equally with the cathode. “Electrode potential” has another meaning in physical chemistry and is therefore inadmissible. The changes considered occur, not in the body of the excitable cell, but around the points of entry and exit of the current. “Local potential,” therefore, refers to the condition at those points.},

	abstract = {Small dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, which include nociceptors, express multiple voltage-gated sodium currents. In addition to a classical fast inactivating tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX-S) sodium current, many of these cells express a TTX-resistant (TTX-R) sodium current that activates near −70 mV and is persistent at negative potentials. To investigate the possible contributions of this TTX-R persistent (TTX-RP) current to neuronal excitability, we carried out computer simulations using the Neuron program with TTX-S and -RP currents, fit by the Hodgkin-Huxley model, that closely matched the currents recorded from small DRG neurons. In contrast to fast TTX-S current, which was well fit using a m3h model, the persistent TTX-R current was not well fit by an m3h model and was better fit using an mh model. The persistent TTX-R current had a strong influence on resting potential, shifting it from −70 to −49.1 mV. Inclusion of an ultra-slow inactivation gate in the persistent current model reduced the potential shift only slightly, to −56.6 mV. The persistent TTX-R current also enhanced the response to depolarizing inputs that were subthreshold for spike electrogenesis. In addition, the presence of persistent TTX-R current predisposed the cell to anode break excitation. These results suggest that, while the persistent TTX-R current is not a major contributor to the rapid depolarizing phase of the action potential, it contributes to setting the electrogenic properties of small DRG neurons by modulating their resting potentials and response to subthreshold stimuli.},

	abstract = {Objective
Conventional electrical stimulation (rectangular pulses) recruits large before small diameter motor neurons and motor neurons close to the electrode before more distant motor neurons. The present study investigated the possibility for changing the recruitment order of electrical stimuli with sub-threshold ramp prepulses.
Methods
The median nerve was stimulated using surface electrodes at the wrist and elbow. Compound motor action potentials were recorded from abductor pollicis brevis and flexor carpi radialis. Stimulus–response curves, nerve conduction velocity and excitation thresholds of abductor pollicis brevis and flexor carpi radials, with and without ramp prepulses, were recorded in order to study the effect of ramp prepulses on axonal excitability.
Results
The conduction velocity of the initial response (10\% of the maximal response) was decreased by 4.3±0.83m/s with ramp prepulses (500ms, 80\% of the excitation threshold). The ramp prepulses also had a differential effect on the excitation thresholds of abductor pollicis brevis and flexor carpi radialis. In addition, ramp prepulses increased the threshold of 10\% of the maximal response more than the threshold of 90\% of the maximal response.
Conclusions
These results demonstrate that large diameter and motor neurons close to the electrode accommodate more to ramp prepulses than small diameter and distant motor neurons, which suggests that ramp prepulses may be used to change the recruitment order of rectangular pulses.
Significance
This technique of ramp prepulses allows stimulation of alternate subsets of motor nerves.},

Orderly, size-related recruitment of motoneurones (MNs) illustrates how hundreds of cells operate as a functional entity to produce a highly deterministic output. The coherent action of the pool depends largely on the distribution of input to its members through the connections of afferent fibres. Three types of spike-triggered averaging have been utilized to study these connections. Impulses in individual Ia afferents elicit excitatory postsynaptic potentials (‘single-fibre’ EPSPs) in about 80\% of homonymous MNs. After spinal transection 100\% may respond, suggesting that Ia fibres project anatomically to all homonymous MNs. Functionally absent Ia connections are due to transmission failure. The sum of all the EPSPs elicited in a large population of MNs was recorded electrotonically from ventral roots. The mean amplitudes of these ‘postsynaptic population potentials’ (PSPPs) were correlated with the conduction velocities (CVs) of the Ia or spindle group II fibres. The greater the distance between the spinal entry point of a Ia fibre and the ventral root, the smaller was the PSPP. Tape recording of multiple afferents and the responses of up to 24 MNs permitted study of as many as 264 possible connections in a single, acute experiment. Construction of wiring diagrams and connectivity matrices from the data showed that functional connectivity is influenced by afferent fibre size, the effect of branching on fibre size, MN size and probably transmission failure, but that on a cell-to-cell level, connectivity does not follow strict, deterministic rules. The results raise the question of how probabilistic connections between afferent fibres and MNs give rise to deterministic outputs from the whole pool.},

The current findings demonstrate that the 5-HT2 antagonists ritanserin and ketanserin, as well as the 5-HT3 antagonist MDL 72222, reduce type I response to a standardized mechanical stimulus in an in vitro skin preparation. In addition, ritanserin blocked the enhancement of type I response produced by 5-HT. These experiments suggest that serotonin is released during mechanical distortion of the Merkel cell membrane and alters action potential generation by the type I ending. In addition, it is possible that serotonin, released from outside the type I complex, influences mechanoreceptor responsiveness. For example, serotonin generated during inflammatory events could enhance type I response to mechanical stimulation and thereby increase symptoms of mechanical allodynia.},

The size of the distorted compound muscle action potential (CMAP) measured with Hopf's technique is corrected using the CMAP size with the modified Kimura technique. This revolves the problem of CMAP distortion due to transient change in muscle conduction in Hopf's technique. In addition, a new equation to correct for the refractory period was developed. This can be applied even if there is stimulus spread. Using our method, one can clearly determine the maximum and minimum velocities. The former corresponds to the motor conduction velocity as measured by the conventional method.},

	abstract = {Neuropathic pain is part of the neurological disease spectrum and may be an expression of severe medical pathology. Painful neuropathies have multiple disguises and may to a certain extent be mimicked by non-neurological pain conditions. Painful neuropathic conditions express themselves with spontaneous and/or abnormal stimulus-evoked pain. The diagnosis of peripheral or central neuropathic pain should be made only when the history and signs are indicative of neuropathy in conjunction with neuroanatomically correlated pain distribution and sensory abnormalities within the area of pain. A future mechanism-based classification of pain has recently been suggested to facilitate the development of mechanism-tailored treatment strategies. This is a sound approach and should be pursued. It is mandatory, however, to retain the traditional organ-based diagnostic workup, which should precede further in-depth characterization of specific pain mechanisms. Extensive preparatory work is needed on how to link certain symptoms and signs to specific mechanisms, as elucidated from animal studies, before we can introduce mechanism-coupled treatment strategies. © 2002 European Federation of Chapters of the International Association for the Study of Pain},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new model for the characterization of electrical activity in the nodal, paranodal and internodal regions of isolated amphibian and mammalian myelinated nerve fibers. It differs from previous models in the following ways: (1) in its ability to incorporate detailed anatomical and electrophysiological data; (2) in its approach to the myelinated nerve fiber as a multi-axial cable; and (3) in the numerical algorithm used to obtain distributed model equation solutions for potential and current. The morphometric properties are taken from detailed electron microscopic anatomical studies (Berthold \& Rydmark, 1983a, Experientia 39, 964–976). The internodal axolemma is characterized as an excitable membrane and model-generated nodal and internodal membrane action potentials are presented. A system of describing equations for the equivalent network model is derived, based on the application of Kirchoff's Current Law, which take the form of multiple cross-coupled parabolic partial differential equations. An implicit numerical integration method is developed and the numerical solution implemented on a parallel processor. Non-uniform spatial step sizes are used, enabling detailed representation of the nodal region while minimizing the number of total segments necessary to represent the overall fiber. Conduction velocities of 20·2 m sec−1 at 20°C for a 15 μm diameter amphibian fiber and 57·6 m sec−1 at 37°C for a 17·5 μm diameter mammalian fiber are achieved, which agrees qualitatively with published experimental data at similar temperatures (Huxley \& Stämpfli, 1949, J. Physiol., Lond. 108, 315–339; Rasminsky, 1973, Arch, Neurol. 28, 287–292). The simulation results demonstrate the ability of this model to produce detailed representations of the transaxonal, transmyelin and transfiber potentials and currents, as well as the longitudinal extra-axonal, periaxonal and intra-axonal currents. Also indicated is the potential contribution of the paranodal axolemma to nodal activity as well as the presence of significant longitudinal currents in the periaxonal space adjacent to the node of Ranvier.},

In nine normal subjects, a single unit was tested with 8–11 000 stimuli at intervals of 0.5 s. After allowing for slow changes in excitability, the probability of excitation was in all cases well fitted by a cumulative Gaussian function. The relative spread (RS) of thresholds (s.d./mean) averaged 1.65 ± 0.26\% (mean ±s.d., n= 9). When threshold was tested 20 ms after the start of a polarizing current, RS increased on depolarization and decreased on hyperpolarization. The product RS × mean threshold also increased on depolarization, especially when threshold was reduced by more than 50\%. When the mean was reduced by 90\%, RS increased above 50\% and the axon sometimes fired spontaneously. Threshold variability was simulated by a computer model of a single node of Ranvier, in which the variability arose because of the stochastic behaviour of nodal sodium channels. The observed values of RS, and potential dependence of RS, were well modelled by a node with 60 000 sodium channels, of which about 1\% were modelled as persistent sodium channels. Threshold variations in the model at resting potential were not primarily due to fluctuations in the state of the node before the stimulus was delivered, but rather to the variable activation of channels by the stimulus pulse. On depolarization, however, current through (mainly persistent) sodium channels caused appreciable fluctuations in membrane potential, which increased RS and the probability of spontaneous firing.},

Conduction velocity of slower fibres increased gradually until about 3 or 4 years of age, and then ranged about 40-50 m/s. The difference between the two velocities increased until 7 or 9 months of age; during the next 8 years, it tended to decrease to about 8-16 m/s. The increasing difference in size between the largest and the smallest myelinated fibres with maturation correlated with the developmental increase of the difference between maximal conduction velocity and conduction velocity of slower fibres.

These unique properties indicate that Nav1.9 has significant effects on the electroresponsive properties of primary nociceptive neurons. Downregulation of Nav1.9, which results from a lack of peripheral glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor following peripheral axotomy, might retune DRG neurons and contribute to their hyperexcitability after nerve injury.

	abstract = {Although physiological and pharmacological evidence suggests the presence of multiple tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) Na channels in neurons of peripheral nervous system ganglia, only one, SNS/PN3, has been identified in these cells to date. We have identified and sequenced a novel Na channel α-subunit (NaN), predicted to be TTX-R and voltage-gated, that is expressed preferentially in sensory neurons within dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia. The predicted amino acid sequence of NaN can be aligned with the predicted structure of known Na channel α-subunits; all relevant landmark sequences, including positively charged S4 and pore-lining SS1–SS2 segments, and the inactivation tripeptide IFM, are present at predicted positions. However, NaN exhibits only 42–53\% similarity to other mammalian Na channels, including SNS/PN3, indicating that it is a novel channel, and suggesting that it may represent a third subfamily of Na channels. NaN transcript levels are reduced significantly 7 days post axotomy in DRG neurons, consistent with previous findings of a reduction in TTX-R Na currents. The preferential expression of NaN in DRG and trigeminal ganglia and the reduction of NaN mRNA levels in DRG after axonal injury suggest that NaN, together with SNS/PN3, may produce TTX-R currents in peripheral sensory neurons and may influence the generation of electrical activity in these cells.},

	abstract = {SUMMARYConventionally recorded surface F waves over the abductor digiti minimi muscle sampled a wide range of conduction velocities (CVs). Single motor unit (MU) F responses to threshold stimulation of the ulnar nerve were recorded with bipolar needle electrodes (BNE); the mean latencies of their fastest associated surface single unit M and F potentials were similar to those of the compound muscle action potential and fastest F wave, indicating that the fastest F wave indexes adequately the fastest motor fibre of the ulnar nerve. The mean surface unit F amplitude of MUs recorded by a BNE was similar to that of voluntary MUs recorded with a spike-triggered averaging technique; an estimated mean of 2–3 MUs per F wave was found by two methods.The frequency distribution of estimated F wave CVs was shifted towards faster values than expected from available studies of the distribution of CVs in single peripheral nerves; it was also higher than predicted from the expected relation between this distribution and the number of MUs per F wave, if an equal chance of activation and recording is assumed for each MU. There was a significant positive correlation between the frequency of F responses and their CV in 81 single MUs recorded by a BNE and tested with 200 threshould stimuli. These findings are consistent with preferential generation of recurrent responses by larger MUs; it may relate to a lesser chance of antidromic discharge in the smaller motor neurons and to a greater chance of collision of orthodromic (reflex) and antidromic impulses in their axons.The higher than expected percentage of all F waves that were repeater shapes or waves, and the presence of several distinct peaks in the distribution of intervals between repeaters of the same shape, suggest special, and heterogeneous, functional and anatomical arrangements in the groups of motor neurons generating them. Repeaters had greater amplitude and area, but similar latency and duration, than F wave shapes that did not repeat, suggesting that the former have a larger number of component MUs.},

	abstract = {1 A technique was developed to counteract the changes in threshold to electrical stimuli of large myelinated cutaneous afferents in the human median nerve induced by ischaemia for 13 min. Intermittent application of polarizing currents was used in five subjects, in whom refractoriness, supernormality and the strength-duration time constant (τSD) were tracked to determine whether compensating for the ischaemia-induced changes in threshold also controlled the ischaemic changes in these excitability parameters. 2 The threshold compensation prevented the ischaemic changes in τSD, an excitability parameter dependent on nodal Na+ channels. Threshold compensation did not prevent the changes in refractoriness and supernormality, whether the compensation began 10, 100 or 200 ms prior to the test stimuli. 3 In three subjects, continuous polarizing current was injected for 13 min to compensate for the ischaemic change in threshold, thus clamping threshold at the pre-ischaemic level. Again, τSD was effectively controlled, but there were still ischaemic changes in refractoriness and supernormality. 4 The effective control of τSD suggests that both the intermittent threshold compensation and the continuous threshold clamp effectively controlled membrane potential at the node of Ranvier. 5 The ischaemic increase in refractoriness when threshold was kept constant could be due to interference with the processes responsible for refractoriness by a metabolic product of ischaemia. The ischaemic change in supernormality during effective compensation probably results from the intrusion of refractoriness into the conditioning-test intervals normally associated with maximal supernormality. 6 The present results indicate that ischaemia has effects on axonal excitability that cannot be readily explained by changes in membrane potential. Specifically, it is suggested that ischaemic metabolites interfere with the recovery of Na+ channels from inactivation.},

	abstract = {1 The present study was undertaken to determine whether mechanisms other than membrane depolarization contribute to the changes in excitability of cutaneous afferents of the median nerve under ischaemic conditions. 2 In six healthy subjects, axonal excitability was measured as the reciprocal of the threshold for a compound sensory action potential (CSAP) of 50 \% maximal amplitude. Refractoriness and supernormality were measured as threshold changes 2 and 7 ms, respectively, after supramaximal conditioning stimuli. The strength-duration time constant (τSD) was calculated from the thresholds for unconditioned CSAPs using test stimuli of 0·1 and 1·0 ms duration. Changes in these indices were measured when subthreshold polarizing currents lasting 10 or 100 ms were applied, before, during and after ischaemia for 13 min. 3 At rest, the change in supernormality produced by polarizing currents was greater with the longer polarizing current, indicating that it took up to 100 ms to charge the internodal capacitance. 4 Refractoriness and its dependence on excitability increased more than expected during ischaemia. Supernormality was abolished during ischaemia, and reached a maximum after ischaemia but was then barely altered by polarizing current. τSD had a similar relationship to excitability before, during and after ischaemia. 5 By contrast, during continuous depolarizing current for 8 min to mimic the depolarization produced by ischaemia, the relationship between excitability and refractoriness was the same during the depolarization as before it. 6 It is suggested that the large increase in refractoriness during ischaemia might be due to interference with the recovery from inactivation of transient sodium channels by an intra-axonal substrate of ischaemia. The post-ischaemic increase in supernormality and the lack of change with changes in axonal excitability can be explained by blockage of voltage-dependent potassium channels.},

Subthreshold membrane depolarization generated a transient decrease in neural excitability and thus an increase in the threshold for stimulation by a subsequent stimulus pulse. The decrease in excitability increased as the duration and amplitude of the subthreshold depolarization were increased, and the increase in threshold was greater for fibers close to the electrode. When a depolarizing stimulus pulse was applied immediately after the subthreshold depolarization, nerve fibers far from the electrode could be stimulated without stimulating fibers close to the electrode.

I: Depolarization-triggered, transient Cl− conductance, GCl(t), followed by a transient, voltage-gated K+ conductance, GK, with an active state a and two inactive states i1 and i2 in series (a-i1-i2). II: Similar GCl(t) as in Type-I but triggered by hyperpolarization; a subsequent increase of GKin this type is indicated but not analyzed in detail. III: Hyperpolarization-induced transient of a voltage-gated activity of an electrogenic pump (i2-a-i2), followed by GCl(t) as in Type-II excitations. Type-III with pump gating is novel as such. GCl(t) in all types seems to reflect the mechanism of InsP−3 and Ca2+-mediated GCl(t) in the action potential in Chara (Biskup et al., 1999). The nonlinear current-voltage-time relationships of Type-I and Type-III excitations have been recorded under voltage-clamp using single saw-tooth command voltages (voltage range: −200 to +50 mV, typical slope: ±1 Vs−1). Fits of the corresponding models to the experimental data provided numerical values of the model parameters. The statistical significance of these solutions is investigated. We suggest that the original function of electrical excitability of biological membranes is related to osmoregulation which has persisted through evolution in plants, whereas the familiar and osmotically neutral action potentials in animals have evolved later towards the novel function of rapid transmission of information over long distances.},

The α subunit isoforms have distinct patterns of development and localization in the nervous system, skeletal and cardiac muscle. In addition, many of the isoforms demonstrate subtle differences in their functional properties. However, there are no clear subfamilies of the channels, unlike the situation with potassium and calcium channels. The subtle differences in the functional properties of the sodium channel isoforms result in unique conductances in specific cell types, which have important physiological effects for the organism.

This study examined whether the first few paralyzed thenar motor units recruited by electrical stimulation of the median nerve were more fatigue resistant than the total thenar motor unit population. The paralyzed thenar muscles of four subjects with chronic cervical spinal cord injury were fatigued by a 2-min intermittent 40-HZ protocol on 2 days. One experiment involved submaximal stimulation, the other supramaximal stimulation. These stimuli resulted in activation of part and all of the thenar muscles, respectively. Relative force loss, force–time integral decline, and slowing of half-relaxation time were always significantly less when only part rather than all of the muscles was fatigued. The part of the paralyzed muscles that was activated was also relatively fatigue resistant compared with control single thenar motor units. Thus, a reversal of recruitment order from fatigable to fatigue-resistant units cannot explain the extreme fatigability of paralyzed muscles. Use of submaximal stimulation during functional electrical stimulation may therefore help to reduce muscle fatigue because it recruits the more fatigue-resistant units. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Axonal spike shape was examined in identified cutaneous C-fibres dissected from the saphenous nerves of anaesthetized pigs and rats, and was found to vary with functional class. In the pig, the action potential duration for heat nociceptor units (duration at half peak amplitude, 1.25±0.16ms, mean±S.E.M., n=32) was significantly longer than the duration for polymodal nociceptive units (0.88±0.11ms, n=32). Both classes of nociceptive C-fibre had action potentials of longer duration than the low-threshold mechanoreceptor units (0.49±0.04ms, n=24) and the inexcitable C-fibres (0.56±0.06ms, n=19). Undershoot durations were also longer in nociceptive than non-nociceptive C-fibres. In contrast, spike amplitudes were similar in all classes of C-afferent. In the rat, as in the pig, the polymodal nociceptor units had action potentials of longer duration (0.75±0.05ms, n=73) than the mechanoreceptor units (0.60±0.01ms, n=23). C-fibres identified as spontaneously active sympathetic efferent units had wider action potentials (main initial peak: 1.01±0.12ms, n=22; undershoot: 4.1±1.23ms, n=20) than the afferent C-fibres (main peak: 0.69±0.03ms, n=130; undershoot: 1.4±0.09ms, n=111). All rat C-fibre types had action potentials with main initial peaks of a similar height. However, cold thermoreceptor units had spikes with significantly smaller undershoots compared to nociceptive or inexcitable C-fibres. It is concluded that there are clear differences in axonal spike shape between the different functional classes of C-fibre and, in particular, that nociceptive C-afferents tend to have axonal action potentials of longer duration than non-nociceptive afferents. However, there is too much overlap in the distributions of spike durations of different functional classes for this measure to be useful on its own for identifying the class of individual C-fibres. The ion channels responsible for the longer duration action potentials may provide a target for the development of highly selective analgesic drugs.},

An algorithm, based on Hirose's method (1986) was then developed to separate the delay sequence from the sampled CAP data sequence, and the nerve conduction velocity distribution (NCVD) was consequently calculated from the delay sequence. The NCVD was found to be the product of the amplitude of the SFAP and the number of fibers. Simulations show that the estimated results were in good agreement with the calculated results. Experiments were performed on ten sciatic nerves from five bullfrogs (Rana pipens) using two independent variables: interelectrode distance and stimulus current strength. The results estimated from CAP's recorded under each condition reflect the corresponding feature of NCVD of the condition. The advantage of the technique is to provide detailed information about both slow and fast conducting fibers. This technique also offers the possibility to directly calculate the nerve fiber diameter distribution from the sampled CAP data sequences.},

A degree of compression, associated with chronic compression disorders in man, was applied to the cat sciatic nerve and resulted in a conduction block typified by early failure of the slow conducting myelinated axons. By contrast, a greater degree of compression, a degree more likely to result in acute compression lesions, produced a different pattern of effect, inducing early conduction failure in the fast conducting myelinated axons. These results are related to earlier studies which have shown that nerve deformation during compression has a differential action upon fast myelinated axons, while nerve ischaemia has a differential action upon slow myelinated axons.},

With the use of spike-triggered averaging, a total of 302 MUs with recruitment thresholds ranging from 1\% to 88\% of maximal voluntary contraction were recorded in the human tibialis anterior muscle in five subjects. The mean (±SD) MU force was 98.3±93.3 mN (mean torque 16.8±15.9 mNm) and the mean contraction time (CT) 46.2±12.7 ms. The correlation coefficients (r) between MU twitch force and CT versus the recruitment threshold in voluntary contractions were +0.68 and –0.38 (P{\textless}0.001), respectively. In voluntary contractions, MUs were recruited in order of increasing size except for only 6\% of the cases; whereas, during transcutaneous electrical stimulation (ES) at the muscle motor point, MU pairs showed a reversal of recruitment order in 28\% and 35\% of the observations, respectively, when the pulse durations were 1.0 ms or 0.1 ms. This recruitment reversal during ES was not related to the magnitude of the difference in voluntary recruitment thresholds between MUs. It is concluded that if the reversal of MU recruitment observed during ES is biophysically controlled by differences in their nerve axon input impedance, in percutaneous stimulation at the motor point, other factors such as the size and the morphological organisation of the axonal branches can also influence the order of activation.},

	abstract = {This is the first examination of sensory receptive properties and associated electrophysiological properties in vivo of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons that express the TTX-resistant sodium channel Nav1.9 (NaN). Intracellular recordings in lumbar DRGs in Wistar rats enabled units with dorsal root C-, Aδ-, or Aα/β-fibers to be classified as nociceptive, low-threshold mechanoreceptive (LTM), or unresponsive. Intracellular dye injection enabled subsequent immunocytochemistry for Nav1.9-like immunoreactivity (Nav1.9-LI).
Nav1.9-LI was expressed selectively in nociceptive-type (C- and A-fiber nociceptive and C-unresponsive) units. Of the nociceptive units, 64, 54, and 31\% of C-, Aδ-, and Aα/β-fiber units, respectively, were positive for Nav1.9-LI. C-unresponsive units were included in the nociceptive-type group on the basis of their nociceptor-like membrane properties; 91\% were positive. Nav1.9-LI was undetectable in Aδ- or Aα/β-fiber LTM units and in one C-LTM unit. Nav1.9-LI intensity was correlated negatively with soma size and conduction velocity in nociceptive units and with conduction velocity in C-fiber units. There was a positive correlation with action potential rise time in nociceptive-type units with membrane potentials equal to or more negative than –50 mV. The data provide direct evidence that Nav1.9 is expressed selectively in (but not in all) C- and A-fiber nociceptive-type units and suggest that Nav1.9 contributes to membrane properties that are typical of nociceptive neurons.},

Slow and fast types of motor unit potentials were collected from 5 normal subjects from their abductor pollicis brevis muscles by low-level voluntary contractions, and near-threshold nerve stimulation, respectively.

	abstract = {A method to activate electrically smaller nerve fibers without activating larger fibers in the same nerve trunk is proposed. The method takes advantage of the fact that action potentials are blocked with less membrane hyperpolarization in larger fibers than in smaller fibers. In this nerve stimulation system, quasitrapezoidal current pulses are delivered through a tripolar cuff electrode to effect differential blocking membrane hyperpolarization. The quasitrapezoidal pulses with a square leading edge, a 350- mu s plateau, and an exponential trailing phase ensure the blockage of propagating action potentials and prevent the occurrence of anodal break excitation. The tripolar cuff electrode design restricts current flow inside the cuff and thus eliminates the undesired nerve stimulation due to a virtual cathode. Experiments were performed on 13 cats. The cuff electrode was placed on the medial gastrocnemius nerve. Both compound and single fiber action potentials were recorded from L7 ventral root filaments. The results demonstrate that larger alpha motor axons could be blocked at lower current levels than smaller alpha motor axons, and that all alpha fibers can be blocked at lower current levels than gamma fibers.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

The use of quasitrapezoidal pulses and a tripolar cuff electrode make selective activation of small motor axons possible, thus recruiting slow-twitch, fatigue-resistant muscle units before fast-twitch, fatigable units in a heterogeneous muscle. Isometric contraction force from the medial gastrocnemius muscle was measured in five cats. The physiological recruitment order was evidenced by larger twitch widths at lower force levels and small twitch widths at higher force levels. The force modulation process was more gradual and fused contractions were obtained at lower stimulation frequencies when the proposed stimulation method was used. Muscles activated by the method were more fatigue-resistant under repetitive activation at low force levels. This stimulation method is simpler to implement and has fewer adverse effects on the neuromuscular system than previous blocking methods.

	abstract = {The influence of the recording site on the motor unit potentials (MUPs) was investigated in the brachial biceps muscle of 8 healthy subjects. The MUPs were recorded with a concentric needle electrode and analyzed with a new decomposition EMG program we call multi-MUP analysis. MUPs had shorter durations and smaller amplitudes at superficial recording sites than at deeper sites in the muscle. This is mainly due to the cannula of the concentric electrode, which records a higher potential at superficial recording sites and partially cancels the recorded potentials from the tip in a differential recording. The MUPs had longer durations and higher amplitudes distally than in the middle of the muscle. The longer durations and spike durations are probably due to increased temporal dispersion at a greater distance from the endplate zone. We do not have an adequate explanation for the larger amplitudes distally in the biceps, they may be due to anatomical factors. To increase the diagnostic sensitivity of quantitative MUP analysis the recordings should be obtained from standardized recording sites. © 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

The principles of electrode placement, stimulus intensity, algorithms for measurement of parameters, causes of variability, reference values, and reporting are discussed. A rigorous standardization of methods has several advantages. The sensitivity of each method is increased without loss of specificity. In addition, reference values obtained in one laboratory can be used in other laboratories as well. Pathophysiological interpretation of findings in different types of neuropathies is also presented.

	abstract = {Voltage-dependent Na-currents were studied, using whole cell voltage clamp, in acutely dissociated, large (mostly Aβ-fiber type) cutaneous afferent dorsal root ganglia neurons (L4 and L5) from the adult rat. Cells were dissociated 14–17 days after axotomy. Control and axotomized neurons were identified via the retrograde marker hydroxy-stilbamide (fluorogold) which was injected into the lateral and plantar region of the skin of the foot and were studied using whole cell patch clamp techniques within 12–20 h of dissociation and plating. Cells were dissociated 14–17 days after injury. Both control and axotomized neurons displayed complex Na-currents composed of components with distinct kinetic and pharmacological properties. The large (48–50 μm diameter) control cutaneous afferent neurons, many of which likely give rise to myelinated Aβ-fibers, exhibited Na-currents with both slow and fast inactivating kinetics. The fast inactivating current in large cutaneous afferent dorsal root ganglion neurons was tetrodotoxin-sensitive and recovered from inactivation ∼four-fold faster at −60 mV (P{\textless}0.001) and ∼six-fold faster at −70 mV (P{\textless}0.001) than the tetrodotoxin-sensitive current in small ({\textless}30 μm diameter) neurons. Further, while the tetrodotoxin-sensitive currents in smaller dorsal root ganglion neurons (mainly C-fiber type) reprime approximately four-fold faster following peripheral axotomy, repriming of the fast inactivating current in larger cutaneous afferent neurons was not significantly altered following axotomy. However, while 77\% of control large neurons were observed to express the slower inactivating, tetrodotoxin-resistant current, only 45\% of these large neurons did after axotomy. These results indicate that large adult cutaneous afferent dorsal root ganglion neurons (Aβ-type) express tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na-currents, which have much faster repriming than Na-currents in small (C-type) neurons, both before, and after axotomy. Like small neurons, the majority of large neurons downregulate the tetrodotoxin-resistant current following sciatic nerve section.},

	abstract = {1. The sensitivities of mammalian myelinated axons to potassium channel blockers was studied over the course of development using in vitro sucrose gap and intra-axonal recording techniques. 2. Application of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP; 1.0 mM) to young nerves led to a delay in return to base line of the sciatic nerve compound action potential and to a postspike positivity (indicative of hyperpolarization) lasting for tens of milliseconds. These effects were very much attenuated during the course of maturation. 3. Tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA; 10 mM) application alone had little effect on the waveform of the compound action potential at any age. However, the 4-AP-induced postspike positivity was blocked by TEA, Ba/+, and Cs+. This block was observed in Ca2+-free electrolyte solutions containing EGTA (1.0 mM). 4. Immature sciatic nerves (approximately 3 wk postnatal) were incubated in a potassium-free electrolyte solution containing 120 mM CsCl for up to 1 h in an attempt to replace internal potassium with cesium. When the nerves were tested in the sucrose gap chamber using solutions containing 3.0 mM CsCl substituted for KCl, the compound action potential was broadened and a prolonged depolarization appeared, but there was no postspike positivity; the CsCl effect was similar to the combined effects of 4-AP and TEA. 5. Intra-axonal recordings were obtained to study the effects of 4-AP and TEA on individual axons. In the presence of 4-AP a single stimulus led to a burst of action potentials followed by a pronounced afterhyperpolarization (AHP) in sensory fibers. The AHP was blocked by TEA. In motor fibers 4-AP application resulted in action potential broadening with no AHP. 6. Repetitive stimulation (200-500 Hz; 100 ms) was followed by a pronounced AHP in both sensory and motor fibers at all ages studied. This activity-elicited AHP was sensitive to TEA at all ages. 7. The results indicate that 4-AP and TEA sensitivity change over the course of development in rat sciatic nerve. The effects of 4-AP are much more pronounced in immature nerves than in mature nerves, suggesting that 4-AP-sensitive channels become masked as they are covered by myelin during maturation. However, the TEA-sensitive channels, demonstrable after repetitive firing, remain accessible to TEA after myelination. These channels therefore may have a nodal representation.},

Noxious LFS of mental nerve afferents caused a significant depression of the early MIR1 and the late MIR2 components. Whereas the onset latency (+25\%), the duration (−42\%) and the integral (+68\%) of the MIR2 were strongly modulated after LFS, only the integral (+35\%) of the MIR1 significantly changed.

Another mixed type of fibres exists with a C conduction velocity (mean value 1-5 m/sec) along its distal pathway and a B conduction velocity (mean value 6 m/sec) along its proximal pathway. The change in conduction velocity progressively occurs in the thoraco-cervical portion of the vagus nerve at least 20 mm from the receptor and at least 40 mm from the T cell. 4. The mixed fibres exhibited a C type excitability cycle in their peripheral pathway and a B type excitability cycle in their central pathway. 5. The histological study using the teasing method demonstrated the existence of unmyelinated fibres, in the thoraco-cervical region of the vagus nerve, becoming progressively myelinated from the periphery to the nodose ganglion. These fibres are likely to be the ones showing mixed electrophysiological properties. They represent (approximately) 10\% of the vagal nerve population. 6.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
        Anodal block and stimulation are poorly documented electrophysiologic phenomenon. Median and superficial radial nerves are examined in a prospective study to explore the significance of anodal block in routine nerve conduction studies. In addition, the anode's ability to stimulate the peripheral nervous system is evaluated. A monopolar stimulation technique is employed to achieve pure anode-generated responses. Additionally, a similar monopolar cathode stimulation technique is utilized and found to be equivalent to the traditional bipolar cathode stimulation. Based on the findings in this investigation, anodal block does not appear to occur during routine nerve conduction studies; however, transposition of the anode and cathode is clinically significant because the increased distance between the cathode and recording electrode results in predictably prolonged latencies. With higher levels of stimulus intensity, sensory, motor and F wave responses are generated by anodal stimulation in all cases. The actual mechanism of anodal stimulation remains uncertain and requires further study. Predicated on the results of this investigation, it appears that anodal block is an unlikely occurrence during routine electrodiagnostic medicine evaluations.

	abstract = {The influence of subthreshold depolarizing prepulses on the threshold current-to-distance and the threshold current-to-diameter relationship of myelinated nerve fibers has been investigated. A nerve fiber model was used in combination with both a simple, homogeneous volume conductor model with a point source and a realistic, inhomogeneous volume conductor model of a monofascicular nerve trunk surrounded by a cuff electrode. The models predict that a subthreshold depolarizing prepulse will desensitize Ranvier nodes of fibers in the vicinity of the cathode and thus cause an increase in the threshold current of a subsequent pulse to activate these fibers. If the increase in threshold current of the excited node is large enough, the excitation will be accompanied by a strong hyperpolarization of adjacent nodes, preventing the propagation of action potentials in these fibers. As fibers close to the electrode are more desensitized by prepulses than more distant ones, it is possible to stimulate distant fibers without stimulating such fibers close to the electrode. Moreover, as larger fibers are more desensitized than smaller ones, smaller fibers have lower threshold currents than larger fibers up to a certain distance from the electrode. The realistic model has provided an additional condition for the application of this method to invert nerve fiber recruitment, i.e., real or virtual anodes should be close to the cathode. When using a cuff electrode for this purpose, in the case of monopolar stimulation the cuff length (determining the position of the virtual anodes) should not exceed twice the internodal length of the fibers to be blocked. Similarly, the distance between cathode and anodes should not exceed the internodal length of these fibers when stimulation is to be applied tripolarly.},

	abstract = {To better understand why sensory neurons express voltage-gated Na+ channel isoforms that are different from those expressed in other types of excitable cells, we compared the properties of the hNE sodium channel [a human homolog of PN1, which is selectively expressed in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons] with that of the skeletal muscle Na+ channel (hSkM1) [both expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells]. Although the voltage dependence of activation was similar, the inactivation properties were different. The V1/2 for steady-state inactivation was slightly more negative, and the rate of open-state inactivation was ∼50\% slower for hNE. However, the greatest difference was that closed-state inactivation and recovery from inactivation were up to fivefold slower for hNE than for hSkM1 channels. TTX-sensitive (TTX-S) currents in small DRG neurons also have slow closed-state inactivation, suggesting that hNE/PN1 contributes to this TTX-S current. Slow ramp depolarizations (0.25 mV/msec) elicited TTX-S persistent currents in cells expressing hNE channels, and in DRG neurons, but not in cells expressing hSkM1 channels. We propose that slow closed-state inactivation underlies these ramp currents. This conclusion is supported by data showing that divalent cations such as Cd2+ and Zn2+ (50–200 μm) slowed closed-state inactivation and also dramatically increased the ramp currents for DRG TTX-S currents and hNE channels but not for hSkM1 channels. The hNE and DRG TTX-S ramp currents activated near −65 mV and therefore could play an important role in boosting stimulus depolarizations in sensory neurons. These results suggest that differences in the kinetics of closed-state inactivation may confer distinct integrative properties on different Na+ channel isoforms.},

	abstract = {Virtually all movements involve the recruitment of motor units from multiple muscles. Given the functional diversity of motor units (motoneurons and the muscle fibers they supply), the effective production of specific movements undoubtedly depends upon some principle(s) to organize the ensemble of active motor units. The principle acting to organize the recruitment of motor units within muscles is the size principle, whereby the first motor units to be recruited have the smallest values for axonal conduction velocity and contractile force, and are the slowest to contract and fatigue. Here we consider the possibility that the size principle applies in the recruitment of motor units across muscles, i.e., that regardless of their muscles of origin, active motor units are recruited in rank order, for example, from low to high conduction velocity. The benefits of orderly recruitment across muscles could be similar to the acknowledged advantages of orderly recruitment within muscles. One benefit is that the neural process involved in organizing active motor units would be simplified. In a muscle-based scheme, the size principle would organize only those motor units within individual muscles, leaving the nervous system with the additional task of coordinating the relative activities of motor units from different muscles. By contrast, in an ensemble-based scheme, orderly recruitment of all motor units according to the size principle would automatically coordinate motor units both within and across motor nuclei. Another potential benefit is the provision for movements with smooth trajectory, the result of interleaving the divergent torque contributions made by motor units from muscles that differ in their orientations about joints. Otherwise, if order were restricted within muscles, the torque trajectory of a joint would change unevenly as participating muscles begin contracting at different times and grade activity at different rates. These considerations support speculation that motor units recruited from co-contracting muscles are collectively recruited according to the size principle.},

	abstract = {Intracellular recording and stimulation were used to study electrical properties of soleus motoneurons and isometric contractile properties of their muscle units. In addition, some muscle units were depleted of glycogen for purposes of studying their morphology. These data were compared for two experimental groups of barbiturate-anesthetized adult cats: those with spinal cords intact (normal) and others with spinal cords transected (ST) 4 mo before study. The greatest change in soleus motoneurons after ST was a decrease in afterhyperpolarization (AHP) duration. Axonal conduction velocity (CV) increased slightly, yet consistently. These data confirm previous findings. The voltage threshold of motoneurons, estimated from the product of rheobase current and input resistance, increased from the normal value of 7.5 mV to 10.1. This resulted from a significant increase in rheobase current after ST, because input resistance was not altered significantly. These data suggest that motoneuron excitability decreased after ST and therefore cannot account for hyperreflexia in chronic ST cats. Measurement of soleus muscle unit isometric contractile properties generally confirmed earlier reports of decreases in twitch time course [both contraction time (CT) and half-relaxation time] and in twitch (Ptw) and maximum tetanic (Pmax) tensions after chronic ST. The ratio Ptw/Pmax increased as a result of a greater decline in tetanic than in twitch tension. No significant change was observed in the fatigue index. Direct measures of muscle unit morphology showed that the specific tension for three ST units fell below the range of four normal units. This was expected given that the innervation ratio was not altered and that the decrease in muscle fiber area after ST was proportionately smaller than the decrease in Pmax. Two lines of evidence showed that motoneuron and muscle unit properties were coordinated before and after ST. First, the normal correlation between AHP duration and CT was nearly as strong after as before ST, and the slope of this relation was not significantly different for normal and ST groups. Second, multivariate statistics (canonical analysis) showed that a combination of all motoneuron electrical properties listed above was strongly correlated with a combination of muscle unit twitch time, Pmax, and Ptw/Pmax for normal and ST groups. In contrast with the conclusions of Gallego et al., we suggest from these data that SOL motor-unit properties are coordinated after ST.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {R. F. Rakowski, D. C. Gadsby, and P. DeWeer have reported a persistent, tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium ion current (INaP) in squid giant axons having a low threshold (-90 mV) and a maximal inward amplitude of −4 μA/cm2 at −50 mV. This report makes the case that most of INaP is attributable to an ion channel mechanism distinct from the classical rapidly activating and inactivating sodium ion current,INa, which is also tetrodotoxin sensitive. The analysis of the contribution ofINa toINaP is critically dependent on slow inactivation of INa. The results of this gating process reported here demonstrate that inactivation ofINa is complete in the steady-state for V {\textgreater} −40 mV, thereby making it unlikely thatINaP in this potential range is attributable to INa. Moreover, −90 mV is well below INa threshold, as demonstrated by the C. A. Vandenberg and F. Bezanilla model ofINa gating in squid giant axons. Their model predicts a persistent current having a threshold of −60 mV and a peak amplitude of −25 μA/cm2 at −20 mV. Modulation of this component by the slow inactivation process predicts a persistent current that is finite in the −60- to −40-mV range having a peak amplitude of −1μA/cm-2 at −50 mV. Subtraction of this current from theINaP measurements yields the portion of INaP that appears to be attributable to an ion channel mechanism distinct fromINa.},

In rabbits decerebrated under halothane-nitrous oxide anaesthesia, application of 30 nM TTX to the desheathed sural nerve completely blocked Aβ and Aδ waves of the compound action potential evoked by electrical stimulation of the nerve at 95 times threshold. The amplitude of C-fibre volleys evoked by these stimuli was reduced to a mean of 60\% of pre-treatment values. Reflexes evoked in medial gastrocnemius motoneurones by sural nerve stimulation showed corresponding changes after TTX treatment, with activation latency increasing from 5-7 ms in the control state to {\textgreater} 100 ms after TTX application. Temporal summation (wind up) in long latency reflexes ({\textgreater} 100 ms) was significantly enhanced after application of TTX. These data show that low concentrations of TTX can selectively block conduction in rabbit sural nerve A-fibres, providing a method for studying the central actions of non-myelinated C-fibres in isolation.},

	abstract = {1. Asymmetrical displacement currents were recorded in the rabbit node of Ranvier by averaging the currents associated with depolarizing and hyperpolarizing pulses in the temperature range 15-25 degrees C with the ends of the fibre cut in 160 mM-CsCl. 2. The identification of the asymmetrical currents as intramembranous current is supported by the findings that (a) the 'on' and 'off' current transients were equal for short and small depolarizing pulses and (b) the total charge displaced reached saturation at (32-111 x 10(-15) C/node) when sufficiently large depolarizations were applied. 3. After a large depolarization to around 50 mV, the 'off' response consisted of a fast phase followed by a slow phase. Lengthening the depolarization reduced the size of the fast response but enhanced the slow response. 4. The steady-state rearrangement of the charges can be described by a Boltzmann distribution of charges with an effective valence of 1.86 and a midpoint potential of -33 mV. The time course of rearrangement of these charges following a change in membrane potential could be fitted reasonably well with a single exponential though a double exponential might have been better at large depolarizations. 5. The steady-state activation curve for Na conductance was measured with various procedures to eliminate the effects of series resistance, which include decreasing peak Na current by TTX, and electronic compensation of the series resistance. The measured steepness of the Na-activation curve corresponds to moving a minimum charge of about 5e to open each Na channel at 22.7 degrees C. 6. The time constant (Tm) for activation of Na current and time constant (Ton) for declining phase of the asymmetry current were of the same order of magnitude but not identical over the potential range -50 to +25 mV. 7. The time course of charge displacement determined from the asymmetry current occurred earlier than did Na activation. Raising the charge displacement curve to second or third power did not yield a curve that matched the time course of Na activation. 8. If all the observed asymmetrical currents are related to the Na-gating system, an upper limit for the number of Na channels per rabbit node is 82,000 and a lower limit for the single channel conductance is 9.8 pS at 18.8 degrees C.},

	abstract = {1. Voltage-clamp studies were carried out on single rabbit myelinated nerve fibres at 14 degrees C with the method of Dodge \& Frankenhaeuser (1958). 2. A method was developed to allow the ionic currents through the modal membrane to be calibrated exactly under voltage-clamp conditions by measuring the resistance of the internode through which the current was injected. 3. The ionic currents in a rabbit node of Ranvier can be resolved into two components, a sodium current and a leak current. Potassium current is almost entirely absent. 4. The sodium currents in rabbit nodes were fitted by the Hodgkin-Huxley model using m2h kinetics. The kinetics of sodium currents in a rabbit node differ from that in a frog node under similar experimental conditions in two respects: (a) inactivation is faster, tau h for rabbit being 2-3 times smaller around -50 mV; (b) the P(Na) (E) curve for mammal is shifted 10-15 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction. 5. From the kinetics of sodium current, the non-propagating rabbit action potential was reconstructed at 14 degrees C. The transient inward sodium current is responsible for the fast initial depolarization phase of the action potential, while the repolarizing phase is accounted for by leak alone. The computed shape of the action potential was in good agreement with the experimentally obtained action potential. 6.

The control group received placebo stimulation over the paretic forearm. All subjects were treated 1 hour per day, for a total of 15 sessions. Outcomes were assessed in a blinded manner with the upper extremity component of the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment and the self-care component of the Functional Independence Measure at pretreatment, after treatment, and at 4 and 12 weeks after treatment.Results—The treatment subjects and control subjects had comparable baseline characteristics. Parametric analyses revealed significantly greater gains in Fugl-Meyer scores for the treatment group after treatment (13.1 versus 6.5; P=0.05), at 4 weeks after treatment (17.9 versus 9.7; P=0.05), and at 12 weeks after treatment (20.6 versus 11.2; P=0.06). Functional Independence Measure scores were not different between groups at any of the time periods (P{\textgreater}0.10).Conclusions—Data suggest that neuromuscular stimulation enhances the upper extremity motor recovery of acute stroke survivors. However, the sample size in this study was too small to detect any significant effect of neuromuscular stimulation on self-care function.},

	abstract = {In motor neuron diseases/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MND-ALS), electrodiagnostic techniques are essential in supporting the diagnosis and excluding other conditions that clinically resemble MND-ALS. Electrodiagnostic techniques can also monitor disease progression and provide prognostic information. Electromyography has an important role in the diagnosis of MND-ALS, but some drawbacks should be borne in mind. Although internationally accepted electrophysiological criteria have been defined to support MND-ALS diagnosis, differences in different laboratories can raise unexpected difficulties in application of diagnosis criteria. Much work needs to be done to increase standardisation of the electrodiagnosis of MND-ALS in order to improve quality. Differential diagnosis with motor axonal neuropathies may be particularly difficult. EMG is an essential tool for the early diagnosis of MND-ALS, which increases potential benefit of therapeutic interventions. A wide discussion among neurophysiologists from different schools could create a sound consensus on early diagnosis of MND-ALS.
Résumé
Dans le cadre des maladies du motoneurone et de la sclérose latérale amyotrophique (MMN/SLA), les techniques de diagnostic électrophysiologique sont essentielles pour établir un diagnostic positif et pour exclure d’autres pathologies cliniquement semblables aux MMN/SLA. Outre cela, les techniques électrophysiologiques peuvent également surveiller et documenter la progression de la maladie, et fournir des informations pronostiques. L’électromyographie joue un rôle important dans le diagnostic de ces affections, mais certaines difficultés doivent être soulignées. Bien que des critères électrophysiologiques acceptés internationalement aient été établis pour étayer le diagnostic de MMN/SLA, les différences d’application dans différents laboratoires peuvent soulever des difficultés importantes à l’heure d’appliquer ces critères. Des efforts sont encore nécessaires pour augmenter la standardisation du diagnostic électrophysiologique de MMN/SLA, afin d’augmenter leur qualité globale. Le diagnostic différentiel avec les neuropathies motrices de type axonal peut-être particulièrement difficile. L’impression après cette revue est que le diagnostic précoce des MMN/SLA devrait bénéficier énormément des discussions et de la recherche d’un consensus entre les neurophysiologistes des différentes écoles.},

	abstract = {Voltage-gated sodium channels perform critical roles for electrical signaling in the nervous system by generating action potentials in axons and in dendrites. At least 10 genes encode sodium channels in mammals, but specific physiological roles that distinguish each of these isoforms are not known. One possibility is that each isoform is expressed in a restricted set of cell types or is targeted to a specific domain of a neuron or muscle cell. Using affinity-purified isoform-specific antibodies, we find that Nav1.6 is highly concentrated at nodes of Ranvier of both sensory and motor axons in the peripheral nervous system and at nodes in the central nervous system. The specificity of this antibody was also demonstrated with the Nav1.6-deficient mouse mutant strain med, whose nodes were negative for Nav1.6 immunostaining. Both the intensity of labeling and the failure of other isoform-specific antibodies to label nodes suggest that Nav1.6 is the predominant channel type in this structure. In the central nervous system, Nav1.6 is localized in unmyelinated axons in the retina and cerebellum and is strongly expressed in dendrites of cortical pyramidal cells and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Ultrastructural studies indicate that labeling in dendrites is both intracellular and on dendritic shaft membranes. Remarkably, Nav1.6 labeling was observed at both presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes in the cortex and cerebellum. Thus, a single sodium channel isoform is targeted to different neuronal domains and can influence both axonal conduction and synaptic responses.},

More useful than the resting threshold are other indices of axonal excitability derived from pairs of threshold measurements, such as refractoriness, supernormality, strength-duration time constant and ‘threshold electrotonus’ (i.e. the changes in threshold produced by long-lasting depolarizing or hyperpolarizing current pulses).

	abstract = {The temperature dependence of different indices of axonal excitability (threshold, latency, refractoriness, supernormality, strength–duration time constant, and rheobase) was studied for cutaneous afferents of 8 healthy human volunteers using threshold tracking. Cooling from ∼32–∼22°C dramatically increased the threshold for a conditioned potential evoked during the relatively refractory period (average increase 573\%) but had little effect on the threshold for unconditioned potentials (increased by 4\% with 0.1-ms test stimuli), strength–duration time constant (increased by 18\%), or rheobase (decreased by 12\%). Cooling increased the latency of the unconditioned test potential by 41\%, but this slowing was small compared with the effect of cooling on the latency slowing attributable to refractoriness. This measure of refractoriness was initially 0.17 ms at a conditioning–test interval of 2 ms, and increased with cooling to 1.30 ms at the same interval. With cooling, refractoriness was both greater at any one conditioning–test interval and longer in duration, extending into intervals normally associated with supernormality. It is concluded that, although cooling affects all excitability indices to some extent, the most prominent feature is the increase in refractoriness. By contrast, strength–duration time constant is influenced little by temperature. © 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Muscle Nerve 22: 51–60, 1999},

These changes indicate that the hypoexcitability was due to axonal hyperpolarization. 3 The activity-dependent hypoexcitability increased in depth and duration the longer the contraction. Following a 1 min contraction, it produced a 24 \% increase in threshold, waning over 15 min. The hypoexcitability was greater than in cutaneous afferents tetanized to produce an equivalent rate-dependent stress. 4 It is concluded that natural activity results in substantial hyperpolarization of active axons and that, for similar discharge rates, the degree of hyperpolarization is greater in motor axons than cutaneous afferents. The greater effect of activity on the excitability of motor axons could be due to less inward rectification and less persistent Na+ conductance than in sensory axons. It is suggested that motor axons may therefore be more susceptible than cutaneous afferents to conduction block at sites of impaired safety margin for impulse conduction.},

The membrane potential was altered using subthreshold depolarizing and hyperpolarizing currents of various sizes (-50\% to +50\% of threshold). Refractoriness and supernormality were determined as the threshold change required to produce the target potential when preceded by a supramaximal stimulus at appropriate conditioning-test intervals. The strength-duration time constant (tauSD) was calculated from the threshold currents using unconditioned test stimuli of 0.1 and 1 ms. There was a near-linear relationship between each of these indices and the reciprocal of threshold (a measure of 'excitability'). It is argued that the voltage dependencies of refractoriness and tauSD largely reflect the behaviour of transient and persistent Na+ channels, respectively, and that the present data therefore quantify aspects of Na+ channel behaviour in human nerves.},

	abstract = {1. A variety of physiological properties of single motor units have been studied in the gastrocnemius muscle (primarily in the medial head) of pentobarbitone-anaesthetized cats. Intracellular stimulation of individual motoneurones ensured functional isolation of the muscle units innervated by them. 2. A system for muscle unit classification was developed using a combination of two physiological properties. Almost all of the units studied could be classified into one of three major types, including two groups with relatively short twitch contraction times (types FF and FR, which were differentiable from one another on the basis of sensitivity to fatigue) and one group with relatively long contraction times (type S, which were extremely resistant to fatigue and were differentiable from FF and FR units on the basis of the shape of unfused tetani). Post-tetanic potentiation of twitch responses was observed in all three muscle unit types. The distributions of axonal conduction velocities for motoneurones innervating FF and FR muscle units were essentially the same, while conduction velocities for motoneurones innervating type S units were, in general, slower. 3. Histochemical profiles of muscle units representative of each of the physiological classes present in the gastrocnemius pool were determined using a method of glycogen depletion for muscle unit identification. Each of the physiological categories of muscle units exhibited a corresponding unique set of muscle fibre staining reactions, or histochemical profile. Within each physiological type, all of the units examined had the same histochemical profile. The results generally support the hypothesis that the histochemical characteristics of muscle fibres are meaningfully related to the physiological properties of the same fibres. However, certain limitations in the detailed application of the hypothesis were also apparent. 4. Systematic assessment of the histochemical profiles of relatively large numbers of fibres belonging to single muscle units provided strong support for the hypothesis that all of the muscle fibres innervated by a single α-motoneurone are histochemically identical.},

Reconstruction of the distribution of fibres in individual units showed that the territories of all three physiological types present in the cat medial gastrocnemius were quite extensive. Within its territory, fibres belonging to the studied unit were distributed more or less uniformly without localized collections. The density of unit fibres suggests that, in cat medial gastrocnemius, a given region of the muscle may be shared by as many as fifty different muscle units. 2. Direct determination of innervation ratios in identified muscle units required complete reconstruction of the three-dimensional distribution of unit fibres within the whole medial gastrocnemius. Satisfactory results were obtained with two type FF units and one type FR unit. 3. Indirect estimates of the average innervation ratios expected for muscle units of different physiological type were obtained using counts of muscle fibres with characteristic histochemical profiles and data on relative frequencies of motor units of known type in the medial gastrocnemius unit pool. Such indirect estimates of innervation ratios agreed with the results of direct fibre counts in identified units for types FF and FR muscle units. Taken in sum, the available evidence suggests that an average muscle unit in the cat medial gastrocnemius contains between 400 and 800 muscle fibres, irrespective of physiological type. 4. Tension production by single muscle units depends on a number of factors, including innervation ratio, the cross-sectional areas of unit fibres and the specific tension outputs of the unit fibres. The present results suggest that the specific tension output of gastrocnemius type S unit muscle fibres is considerably smaller (about 0·6 kg/cm2) than in either FF units (about 1·5–2·0 kg/cm2) or type FR units (2·6–2·9 kg/cm2).},

In some axons, however, the nodes of Ranvier are more closely spaced than in normal peripheral nerve. Analytic arguments have suggested that when internodal distance (L) alone is changed, the plot of theta versus L should have a relatively flat maximum. This was confirmed by several previous computer simulations of myelinated axons, but internode lengths of less than half the normal case were not examined. In order to gain insight into impulse propagation in myelinated and remyelinated fibres with short internodal lengths, the present study examines the conduction velocity and spike configuration for a wide range of internodal lengths. As L becomes large, theta falls and finally propagation is blocked; as L becomes small, theta decreases more and more steeply. From this, it is predicted that for fibres with very short internodal lengths, small local changes in L should affect substantially the conduction velocity.},

	abstract = {1. The relationships between maximum tetanic tension (P0), endurance time, and axonal conduction velocity (CV) were investigated in fast-twitch motor units of the cat flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscles, and in one flexor digitorum longus (FDL) muscle. Endurance time was the length of time that a unit could maintain 25\% of its maximum tetanic tension during a sustained contraction. Motor-unit tension was "clamped" at 25\% of maximum by altering the stimulation rate of a unit's motor axon through computer feedback control. 2. In individual experiments, including the one investigated FDL muscle, an inverse relation was consistently found between maximum tension and endurance time. Pooled data from the FCR and MG muscles also resulted in significant correlations between maximum tetanic tension and endurance time. 3. Following the force-clamp contraction, some motor units were subjected to the standard fatigue test of Burke and colleagues (6). Motor units were classified as type FR (fast twitch, fatigue resistant) or type FF* (fast twitch, fast fatiguing after the force-clamp contraction). For both type FR and FF* units, maximum tetanic tension and endurance time were found to be inversely related. However, no correlation was found between maximum tetanic tension and fatigue index for type FR units. Only when all type F (FR + FF*) units were considered as a population was there a significant correlation between these two properties. 4. Other investigators have shown that maximum tetanic tension and axonal conduction velocity are highly correlated with the recruitment order of motoneurons (e.g., Refs. 2, 26). Endurance time was found to be more tightly coupled with contraction strength than with conduction velocity. In 12 of 14 experiments, significant Spearman rank correlation coefficients were found between endurance time and tension, whereas significant correlations were found in only 3 of 14 experiments for endurance time and conduction velocity. 5. Pairs of motor units isolated from the same muscle were formed to see if the unit with the smaller tension had the slower conduction velocity and the longer endurance time. Across all muscles, the probability that the unit with the smallest tension had the greatest endurance time was 0.91 (441 of 487 pairs). By contrast, the probability that the least forceful unit of the pair had the slowest conduction velocity was 0.61. 6. In four experiments, pairs of type-identified units were examined. Among FR-FR pairs, the least forceful unit had the greatest endurance time in 88\% of 43 pairs. For FF*-FF* pairs, the percentage was somewhat lower, 72\% of 29 pairs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Velocity changes following single and double conditioning impulses were studied by microneurography in single human C fibres to provide information about axonal membrane properties. C units were identified as mechano-responsive (n= 19) or mechano-insensitive (12) nociceptors, cold-sensitive (8) or sympathetic fibres (9), and excited by single, double and triple electrical stimuli to the skin at mean rates of 0.25–2 Hz. The interval between single or paired (20 ms apart) conditioning stimuli and test stimulus was then varied between 500 and 2 ms, and recovery curves of velocity change against inter-spike interval constructed, allowing for changes in these variables with distance. All fibres exhibited an initial (4–24 ms) relative refractory phase, and a long-lasting ({\textgreater}500 ms) ‘H2’ phase of reduced velocity, attributed to activation of Na+/K+-ATPase. Mechano-responsive nociceptors exhibited an intermediate phase of either supernormality or subnormality, depending on stimulation rate. Mechano-insensitive nociceptors behaved similarly, but all were supernormal at 1 Hz. Sympathetic units exhibited only a long-lasting supernormality, while cold fibres exhibited a briefer supernormal and a late subnormal phase (H1), similar to A fibres. A pre-conditioning impulse doubled H2 and increased H1, but did not augment supernormality or the subnormality of similar time course. Like A fibre supernormality, these phenomena were explained by a passive cable model, so that they provide an estimate of membrane time constant. Nociceptor membrane time constants (median 110 ms, n= 17) were rather insensitive to membrane potential, indicating few active voltage-dependent potassium channels, whereas sympathetic time constants were longer and reduced by activity-dependent hyperpolarisation.},

	abstract = {Conventional electrophysiological tests of nerve function focus on the number of conducting fibers and their conduction velocity. These tests are sensitive to the integrity of the myelin sheath, but provide little information about the axonal membrane. Threshold tracking techniques, in contrast, test nerve excitability, which depends on the membrane properties of the axons at the site of stimulation. These methods are sensitive to membrane potential, and to changes in membrane potential caused by activation of ion channels and electrogenic ion pumps, including those under the myelin sheath. This review describes the range of threshold tracking techniques that have been developed for the study of human nerves in vivo: resting threshold is compared with the threshold altered by a change in environment (e.g., ischemia), by a preceding single impulse (e.g., refractoriness, superexcitability) or impulse train, or by a subthreshold current (e.g., threshold electrotonus). Few clinical studies have been reported so far, mainly in diabetic neuropathy and motor neuron disease. Threshold measurements seem well suited for studies of metabolic and toxic neuropathies but insensitive to demyelination. Until suitable equipment becomes more widely available, their full potential is unlikely to be realized. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Muscle Nerve 21: 137–158, 1998},

	abstract = {1. The time constants of motor and sensory nerve fibres were studied in normal human ulnar nerves by the method of latent addition, using threshold tracking to follow the recovery of excitability after brief conditioning current pulses. The 60 microseconds test and conditioning stimuli were applied at the wrist, and the conditioning stimuli were set to 90, 60, 30, -30, -60 and -90\% of the control threshold current. Compound muscle action potentials were recorded from abductor digiti minimi, and sensory nerve action potentials from the little finger. 2. Recovery from depolarizing conditioning pulses was slower than recovery from hyperpolarizing pulses and strongly dependent on conditioning pulse amplitude. The voltage dependence of latent addition was attributed to subthreshold activation of sodium channels (local response). 3. Motor and sensory nerve excitability generally recovered from -90\% hyperpolarizing pulses as the sum of two exponential components, although the slow component was negligible in some motor nerves. The fast component (time constant 43.3 +/- 2.0 microseconds, mean +/- S.E.M., n = 9) was similar between motor and sensory fibres in the same subject. It showed no consistent voltage dependence, and was attributed to a passive input time constant of the fibres. The slow component of recovery from hyperpolarizing pulses was greater in sensory than in motor fibres and was voltage dependent: it could be greatly increased in motor and sensory fibres by steady depolarization. It was attributed to a regenerative membrane current, active at the resting potential in sensory and at least some motor nerves. 4. The latent addition responses were compared with the computed responses of four theoretical models. Both motor and sensory responses were well fitted by a model in which a fraction of the sodium channels (less in motor than in sensory fibres) were activated at potentials 20 mV more negative than normal and at half the normal rate, and did not inactivate. 5. It is concluded that the differences in latent addition between motor and sensory fibres are primarily due to differences in non-classical, voltage-dependent ion channels, active close to the resting potential. These 'threshold channels' may help to account for the longer strength-duration time constant of sensory fibres, for their lower rheobase, and for their greater tendency to fire repetitively.},

	abstract = {The changes in excitability and supernormality of sensory and motor axons of the median (or ulnar) nerve were tracked during and following ischaemia at the wrist for periods of 5–20 min in normal human volunteers. Supernormality was defined as the fractional increase in excitability produced by a maximal conditioning stimulus, 10 ms before the test stimulus. With relatively brief periods of ischaemia (\&lt;10 min), sensory and motor axons behaved similarly, with an increase in excitability (producing a decrease in threshold) and a decrease in supernormality during ischaemia and a long-lasting decrease in excitability (and increase in supernormality) following release of ischaemia. Most subjects reported paraesthesiae during brief periods of ischaemia but not after its release. No one experienced fasciculation. The threshold changes were generally similar during longer periods of ischaemia, but in the post-ischaemic phase the behaviour of sensory and motor axons diverged. After a rapid post-ischaemic increase, the threshold of sensory axons decreased, approaching the pre-ischaemic level, before rising again and then slowly returning to the control level. Sensory axons of different threshold behaved in a qualitatively similar manner, with no evidence of a bimodal distribution of thresholds in the post-ischaemic phase (as occurs with motor axons when the ischaemia is sufficient to produce fasciculation; see Bostock et al. J. Physiol (Lond) 1991;441:537–57). The ‘notch’ on the threshold plot for sensory axons lasted 20–40 min and was accompanied by a relatively small but appropriate change in supernormality. No such ‘notch’ was seen with motor axons. The changes in latency were generally similar for sensory and motor axons, largely paralleling the supernormality plots, except at the time of the ‘notch’. To test the hypothesis that the differences in behaviour of sensory and motor axons resulted from differences in inward rectification activated by hyperpolarization, the changes in threshold produced by long-lasting (300 ms) depolarizing and hyperpolarizing current pulses were compared for sensory and motor axons. In seven of eight subjects, there was evidence of more inward rectification in sensory axons. In the eighth subject, motor axons behaved similarly to sensory axons. It is concluded that a difference in inward rectification contributes to but is insufficient by itself to account for the differences in behaviour of sensory and motor axons and that the greater propensity of sensory axons to discharge ectopically cannot be attributed to a single factor.},

	abstract = {1. We have investigated the origin of post-ischaemic ectopic discharges in human nerve by recording changes in electrical excitability following periods of ischaemia (15-20 min) sufficient to induce spontaneous motor fasciculations. The ulnar nerve was stimulated beneath a pressure cuff on the upper arm, and compound motor action potentials recorded from abductor digiti minimi. 2. On releasing the cuff after 15 min of ischaemia, thresholds to short current pulses increased in two distinct phases: a slow phase followed by a rapid rise to a peak threshold. The rapid rise was too fast to track (i.e. 100\% threshold increase in less than 4 s), and was sometimes followed after 30-40 s by an equally rapid fall. Small polarizing currents affected the timing of the rapid threshold increase, as if it was occurring at a particular membrane potential. 3. By recording complete stimulus-response curves every few seconds, we found that the rapid threshold changes were associated with a bimodal distribution of thresholds. Most fibres were found in either a high-threshold or low-threshold state, and these two states converged over a period of about 10 min. 4. Spontaneous motor fasciculations were only recorded after the rapid rise in threshold and when the fibres existed in two threshold states. The spontaneous activity was not responsible for inducing the two states, since they could also be recorded in its absence. 5. A computer model of a human motor axon node and internode was constructed, incorporating channel types demonstrated in other axons, and channel densities adjusted to match the responses of human axons to depolarizing and hyperpolarizing current pulses. An increase in extracellular potassium concentration produced a region of negative slope conductance in the current-voltage relationship of the model, and the appearance of two stable states with enhanced activity of the electrogenic sodium pump. 6. Transitions between the two stable states of the model could account qualitatively for the rapid threshold changes recorded from post-ischaemic axons. In the model, spontaneous action potentials occurred following some transitions from the high potential state to the low potential state. We suggest that post-ischaemic motor fasciculations in man also involve transitions between two equilibrium states, occurring in axons with high extracellular potassium and high electrogenic pump activity.},

	abstract = {1. The mechanism of post-ischaemic ectopic impulse generation in nerve is not known, and previous measurements of excitability changes in human motor axons have appeared to conflict. We have used automatic threshold tracking and different stimulus-response combinations to follow the effects on excitability of brief (5-10 min) periods of ischaemia, too short to induce motor fasciculations. Excitability changes have been compared at different sites in axons innervating hand, arm and foot muscles. 2. Threshold was determined as the percutaneous stimulus current required to excite a single motor unit, or to evoke a constant multiunit response, after rectifying and integrating the electromyogram (EMG). Three different waveforms of stimulus current were compared: short (less than or equal to 2 ms) pulses, long (100-200 ms) pulses to measure rheobase, and 100 ms current ramps. We also measured accommodation by recording the effects of subthreshold depolarizing currents on excitability. 3. Ischaemic and post-ischaemic excitability changes were greatest in the proximal parts of the longest motor axons, and greater if the sphygmomanometer cuff was inflated over, rather than proximal to, the stimulating site. 4. Using integrated EMG responses from abductor digiti minimi, the ulnar nerve stimulated above the elbow became rapidly much less excitable after ischaemia when tested with short pulses, but more excitable when tested with current ramps. The rheobase rose briefly, but then fell, often below resting level, always staying below the pulse and ramp thresholds. 5. The latency of the response to a rheobasic stimulus altered in parallel with the threshold to short current pulses, and increased dramatically after ischaemia. This latency increase was associated with a prolonged phase of ‘negative accommodation’, i.e. the continued increase in excitability to a maintained subthreshold depolarizing current. 6. Changes in excitability and accommodation similar to those occurring after ischaemia were recorded following high frequency trains of stimuli. They were attributed primarily to hyperpolarization by the electrogenic sodium pump, since comparable changes could be induced by passing a steady hyperpolarizing current through the stimulating electrode. 7. Threshold and latency recordings from single motor units during and after ischaemia resembled in most respects the multiunit responses, but single unit rheobase did not show a post-ischaemic fall below the resting level. Repetitive firing contributed to the low multiunit thresholds recorded with long current pulses during the post-ischaemic period. 8. We conclude that human motor nerves become simultaneously both more and less excitable than normal after 10 min of ischaemia, depending on the choice of stimulus and response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Thresholds to electrical stimulation have been recorded, concurrently with the membrane currents of conducted impulses, at many positions along undissected single fibres in rat spinal roots. In normal myelinated fibres, distinct threshold minima invariably coincided with sites of inward current generation, and were therefore identified as nodes of Ranvier. Between nodes, the thresholds rose by an order of magnitude. At normal nodes, the charge thresholds were linearly related to stimulus duration, as predicted by computer simulations of a model myelinated fibre (Bostock, 1983). The strength-duration time constants averaged 64.9 +/- 8.3 microseconds (mean +/- S.D.) at 37 degrees C, and had a Q10 of 1/1.39. They were relatively insensitive to changes in inter-electrode distance, or to partial anaesthetization with tetrodotoxin. In fibres treated with diphtheria toxin 6-8 days previously, to induce paranodal or segmental demyelination, threshold minima were found both at nodes and in internodal regions generating inward membrane current. In these fibres strength-duration curves were of the same general form as at normal nodes, but with strength-duration time constants increased at widened nodes (up to 350 microseconds) and at excitable internodes (600-725 microseconds). Comparison with the computer model indicated that these changes were most likely due to exposure of axon membrane with a time constant much longer than that of the normal nodal membrane. In none of the demyelinated fibres examined have we found any evidence of hyperexcitability.},

Strength-duration curves have been plotted, and compared with three strength-duration equations that have been proposed in the past. The simple, linear relation between stimulus charge and stimulus duration proposed by Weiss (1901) provided the best fit to the computed data. The effects on the strength-duration relationship of changes in twelve parameters of the model were determined and expressed in terms of the strength-duration time constant and rheobasic current. The rheobase depended primarily on conductances, whereas the strength-duration time constant depended on the electrotonic time constant and also on the rate of sodium activation. The model predicts strength-duration curves of the same form, for extracellular or intracellular stimulation where the external resistance is low and uniform. Tripolar stimulation, with anodes over adjacent rather than remote nodes, is predicted to result in much shorter strength-duration time constants, but with a similar sensitivity to nodal membrane parameters. The limitations of strength-duration measurements on myelinated nerves are discussed in the light of these simulations.},

The axonal conduction velocity and refractory period of 117 motor units were determined and the findings were compared to those in previously studied normal subjects. The axonal conduction velocity spectrum was 15-52 m/s. Fifteen per cent of all motor units had axonal conduction velocities below 30 m/s which is below the normal range. When test stimulus strength was 10\% above the axonal threshold at rest the refractory period was 1.88 +/- 0.43 ms which is slightly longer than the corresponding value in healthy subjects (1.67 +/- 0.25 ms). The relationship between the axonal conduction velocity and refractory period observed in healthy subjects did not hold for these patients. Thirty-eight per cent of all motor motor units with axonal conduction velocities within the normal range had refractory periods longer than 2.0 ms which was only infrequently observed in healthy subjects. When test stimulus strength was 50\% above the axonal threshold at rest the refractory period was 1.16 +/- 0.42 ms which was significantly longer (p less than 0.02) than in healthy subjects (0.64 +/- 0.21 ms). At this stimulus strength 40\% of all motor units with axonal conduction velocities within the normal range had refractory periods above 1.0 ms which was never the case in healthy subjects.

In the patients without muscle fiber differentiation, all motor units had intermediate firing properties and a low axonal conduction velocity.

	abstract = {Aims
The aim of this present study was to investigate the changes of peripheral sensory nerve excitability produced by propofol.
Main methods
In a recently described in vitro model of rodent saphenous nerve we used the technique of threshold tracking (QTRAC®) to measure changes of axonal nerve excitability of Aβ-fibres caused by propofol. Concentrations of 10μMol, 100μMol and 1000μMol were tested. Latency, peak response, strength-duration time constant (τSD) and recovery cycle of the sensory neuronal action potential (SNAP) were recorded.
Key findings
Our results have shown that propofol decreases nerve excitability of rat primary sensory afferents in vitro. Latency increased with increasing concentrations (0μMol: 0.96±0.07ms; 1000μMol 1.10±0.06ms, P{\textless}0.01). Also, propofol prolonged the relative refractory period (0μMol: 1.79±1.13ms; 100μMol: 2.53±1.38ms, P{\textless}0.01), and reduced superexcitability (0 μMol: −14.0±4.0\%; 100μMol: −9.5±5.5\%) and subexcitability (0μMol: 7.5±1.2\%; 1000μMol: 3.6±1.2) significantly during the recovery cycle (P{\textless}0.01).
Significance
Our results have shown that propofol decreases nerve excitability of primary sensory afferents. The technique of threshold tracking revealed that axonal voltage-gated ion channels are significantly affected by propofol and therefore might be at least partially responsible for earlier described analgesic effects.},

Results: Threshold electrotonus and superexcitability differed between nerves (APB{\textgreater}MG{\textgreater}TA axons) that may reflect differences in fast K+ conductance. APB axons had larger S2 accommodation and undershoot than TA and MG axons, indicating greater slow K+ conductance. TA axons demonstrated greater accommodation during hyperpolarizing currents than MG and APB axons, suggestive of greater inwardly rectifying current.

	abstract = {Study aims
The technique of threshold tracking to test axonal excitability gives information about nodal and internodal ion channel function. We aimed to investigate variability of the motor excitability measurements in healthy controls, taking into account age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and small changes in skin temperature.
Materials and methods
We examined the left median nerve of 47 healthy controls using the automated threshold-tacking program, QTRAC. Statistical multiple regression analysis was applied to test relationship between nerve excitability measurements and subject variables.
Results
Comparisons between genders did not find any significant difference (P{\textgreater}0.2 for all comparisons). Multiple regression analysis showed that motor amplitude decreases with age and temperature, stimulus-response slope decreases with age and BMI, and that accommodation half-time decrease with age and temperature.
Conclusion
The changes related to demographic features on TRONDE protocol parameters are small and less important than in conventional nerve conduction studies. Nonetheless, our results underscore the relevance of careful temperature control, and indicate that interpretation of stimulus-response slope and accommodation half-time should take into account age and BMI. In contrast, gender is not of major relevance to axonal threshold findings in motor nerves.
Résumé
But de l’étude
La technique dite de threshold tracking fournit des informations sur la fonction nodale et internodale de la membrane axonale. Notre étude a porté sur la variabilité des mesures d’excitabilité des fibres motrices chez des sujets témoins sains, tenant compte de l’âge, du sexe, de l’indice de masse corporelle (IMC) et de faibles variations de la température cutanée.
Patients et méthodes
Nous avons examiné le nerf médian gauche chez 47 sujets témoins sains en utilisant le threshold tracking, QTRAC automatisé. Une analyse statistique de régression multiple a été utilisée pour tester la relation entre les mesures d’excitabilité nerveuse et les variables individuelles.
Résultats
Aucune différence significative n’a été retrouvée entre les sexes (p{\textgreater}0,2 pour toutes les comparaisons). L’analyse de régression multiple a, par contre, montré que l’amplitude de la réponse motrice diminuait avec l’âge et la température, que la pente de la relation stimulus-réponse diminuait avec l’âge et l’IMC, et que la demi-vie d’accommodation diminuait avec l’âge et la température.
Conclusions
Les variations liées aux caractéristiques démographiques des paramètres du protocole TRONDE sont faibles et moins importantes que dans les études classiques de conduction nerveuse. Nos résultats soulignent néanmoins l’importance d’un contrôle minutieux de la température et indiquent que l’interprétation de la pente de la relation stimulus-réponse ainsi que de la demi-vie d’accommodation devrait tenir compte de l’âge et de l’IMC. En revanche, le sexe n’est pas d’une grande importance pour apprécier les résultats de la méthode dite de threshold tracking appliquée aux nerfs moteurs.},

	abstract = {Objective
The aim of this study was to investigate differences in excitability properties of human median and superficial radial sensory axons (e.g., axons innervating the glabrous and hairy skin in the hand). Previous studies have shown that excitability properties differ between motor and sensory axons, and even among sensory axons between median and sural sensory axons.
Methods
In 21 healthy subjects, threshold tracking was used to examine excitability indices such as strength–duration time constant, threshold electrotonus, supernormality, and threshold change at the 0.2ms inter-stimulus interval in latent addition. In addition, threshold changes induced by ischemia for 10min were compared between median and superficial radial sensory axons.
Results
Compared with radial sensory axons, median axons showed shorter strength–duration time constant, greater threshold changes in threshold electrotonus (fanning-out), greater supernormality, and smaller threshold changes in latent addition. Threshold changes in both during and after ischemia were greater for median axons.
Conclusions
These findings suggest that membrane potential in human median sensory axons is more negative than in superficial radial axons, possibly due to greater activity of electrogenic Na+/K+ pump. These results may reflect adaptation to impulses load carried by median axons that would be far greater with a higher frequency.
Significance
Biophysical properties are not identical in different human sensory axons, and therefore their responses to disease may differ.},

	abstract = {Chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity is a serious consequence of cancer treatment, which occurs with some of the most commonly used chemotherapies1,2. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy produces symptoms of numbness and paraesthesia in the limbs and may progress to difficulties with fine motor skills and walking, leading to functional impairment. In addition to producing troubling symptoms, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy may limit treatment success leading to dose reduction or early cessation of treatment. Neuropathic symptoms may persist long-term, leaving permanent nerve damage in patients with an otherwise good prognosis3. As chemotherapy is utilised more often as a preventative measure, and survival rates increase, the importance of long-lasting and significant neurotoxicity will increase., There are no established neuroprotective or treatment options and a lack of sensitive assessment methods. Appropriate assessment of neurotoxicity will be critical as a prognostic factor and as suitable endpoints for future trials of neuroprotective agents. Current methods to assess the severity of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy utilise clinician-based grading scales which have been demonstrated to lack sensitivity to change and inter-observer objectivity4. Conventional nerve conduction studies provide information about compound action potential amplitude and conduction velocity, which are relatively non-specific measures and do not provide insight into ion channel function or resting membrane potential. Accordingly, prior studies have demonstrated that conventional nerve conduction studies are not sensitive to early change in chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity4-6. In comparison, nerve excitability studies utilize threshold tracking techniques which have been developed to enable assessment of ion channels, pumps and exchangers in vivo in large myelinated human axons7-9., Nerve excitability techniques have been established as a tool to examine the development and severity of chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity10-13. Comprising a number of excitability parameters, nerve excitability studies can be used to assess acute neurotoxicity arising immediately following infusion and the development of chronic, cumulative neurotoxicity. Nerve excitability techniques are feasible in the clinical setting, with each test requiring only 5 -10 minutes to complete. Nerve excitability equipment is readily commercially available, and a portable system has been devised so that patients can be tested in situ in the infusion centre setting. In addition, these techniques can be adapted for use in multiple chemotherapies., In patients treated with the chemotherapy oxaliplatin, primarily utilised for colorectal cancer, nerve excitability techniques provide a method to identify patients at-risk for neurotoxicity prior to the onset of chronic neuropathy. Nerve excitability studies have revealed the development of an acute Na+ channelopathy in motor and sensory axons10-13. Importantly, patients who demonstrated changes in excitability in early treatment were subsequently more likely to develop moderate to severe neurotoxicity11. However, across treatment, striking longitudinal changes were identified only in sensory axons which were able to predict clinical neurological outcome in 80\% of patients10. These changes demonstrated a different pattern to those seen acutely following oxaliplatin infusion, and most likely reflect the development of significant axonal damage and membrane potential change in sensory nerves which develops longitudinally during oxaliplatin treatment10. Significant abnormalities developed during early treatment, prior to any reduction in conventional measures of nerve function, suggesting that excitability parameters may provide a sensitive biomarker.},

To assess the applicability and lasting effects on axonal membrane excitability of transcutaneous peripheral nerve direct current stimulation (pDCS).
Methods
We included 15 healthy subjects. pDCS was performed with the active electrode placed over the left forearm and the reference electrode on the back of the hand. We used 5×5cm rubber electrodes and the current applied was 2.5mA during 15minutes. Three pDCS sessions were performed on the same day with a 20-minute interval between them: first a sham stimulation, followed by cathodal and anodal stimulations in random order. Motor nerve excitability measurements were performed immediately after each pDCS session using the TRONDNF nerve excitability protocol of the QTRAC program.
Results
The protocol was completed and well tolerated in all subjects. There were no consistent significant differences in excitability measurements between the three sessions.
Conclusions
No consistent long-lasting effects were noted on peripheral nerve excitability beyond the period of application of pDCS. We showed that a 15-minute session of DCS is not able to produce lasting changes in axonal excitability, supporting the hypothesis that the functional and clinical impact of DCS protocols applied to the central nervous system is related to long-term synaptic changes rather sustained local changes in axonal rest membrane potential.},

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterised by the increased excitability of motoneurons and heterogeneous loss of axons. The heterogeneous nature of the disease process among fibres may show variability of excitability in ALS.
Methods
Multiple nerve excitability tests were performed in 28 ALS patients and 23 control subjects, by tracking at the varying threshold levels (10\%, 20\%, 40\% and 60\% of maximum amplitudes).
Results
In normal controls, excitability measures at low target levels have the following characteristics compared to those at high target levels: longer strength–duration time constant, greater threshold reduction during depolarising currents and smaller threshold increase to hyperpolarising currents. ALS patients had less clear amplitude dependency of the parameters than the controls, indicating variability of axonal excitability. Three ALS patients demonstrated greater target-amplitude-dependent threshold changes in threshold electrotonus than controls, suggesting selective axonal hyperexcitability.
Conclusions
Some of the ALS patients had variable axonal excitability at different target amplitudes, suggesting preferential hyperexcitability in the axons with low target amplitude levels.
Significance
Variable membrane potentials of motor axons in ALS may be assessed by recording excitability testing at different target amplitude levels.},

	abstract = {Objectives The conformational state of voltage-gated sodium channels is an important determinant for the efficacy of both local anesthesia and electrical neuromodulation techniques. This study investigated the role of subthreshold preconditioning ramp currents on axonal nerve excitability parameters in the presence of sodium channel blockers in myelinated A and unmyelinated C fibers. Materials and Methods A- and C-fiber compound action potentials were recorded extracellularly in vitro in saphenous nerve from adult rats. Nerve fibers were stimulated with a supramaximal current pulse either alone or after a 300-msec conditioning polarizing ramp current (between −10\% and +100\% of the original threshold current) in the presence and absence of lidocaine and tetrodotoxin (TTX). A computerized threshold tracking program (QTRAC©, Institute of Neurology, University College London, London, UK) was used to determine the membrane thresholds. Results Preconditioning ramp currents of weak strengths increased membrane excitability. Stronger preconditioning ramp currents enhanced the potency of lidocaine and TTX to increase excitability thresholds. In A and C fibers stimulated with ramp currents of 110\% (A fibers) and 40\% (C fibers), lidocaine (80 μM) induced a 168 ± 15\% (p {\textless} 0.001) and 302 ± 23\% (p {\textless} 0.001) increase in threshold, respectively (no ramp current: 135 ± 9\% and 124 ± 4\%, respectively). TTX (16 nM) induced an increase in threshold of 455 ± 45\% (p {\textless} 0.001) and 214 ± 22\% (p = 0.005), respectively (no ramp current: 205 ± 12\% and 128 ± 6\%, respectively). Conclusions Slow preconditioning ramp stimuli inactivate sodium currents. In the presence of sodium channel blockers, stronger ramp stimuli cause an increase in threshold, which is larger than that caused by the sodium channel blocker alone. Therefore, we conclude that small depolarizing ramp currents could be used to increase excitability threshold in the presence of low concentrations of local anesthetics. These additive effects might represent a target to address with peripheral nerve stimulation in order to suppress afferent pain signaling.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Isolated bulbar palsy (IBP) is a rare variant that can show a benign course, while progressive bulbar palsy (PBP) has been regarded as a bulbar-dominant type of classical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (cALS). This study aimed to identify differences in the excitability properties between them.Methods: We consecutively collected data on 22 ALS patients: 13 with cALS, 5 with PBP, and 4 with IBP. An automated nerve excitability test (NET) was applied to measure the strength–duration time constant, threshold electrotonus (TE), current–threshold relationship, and recovery cycle. The axonal excitability properties were compared between the ALS groups and 25 controls.Results: Compared to controls, the cALS group showed a greater change in the depolarizing phase of TE of 90–100 ms after depolarizing current [TEd(90–100)] (53.3±1.3 [mean±SEM] for cALS and 49.0±0.7 for control, P{\textless}0.01) and lower S2 accommodation (19.6±0.8 and 22.6±0.7, respectively; P=0.01). There was a nonsignificant tendency for a high TEd(90–100) pattern to be less prominent in the IBP group than in the PBP group (51.5±4.22 and 48.8±1.5, respectively). In addition, all of the parameters of nerve excitability other than S2 accommodation in the PBP and IBP groups did not differ significantly from those in the controls.Conclusions: The excitability properties of IBP and PBP differ from those of cALS. The pattern of NET in PBP was more similar to that in cALS than that in IBP. These findings suggest that IBP is a different entity from bulbar-dominant ALS and PBP.},

However, little has been known on the nerve excitability properties of axons with different stimulation thresholds and the effects of aging and peripheral neuropathy to those. We performed multiple nerve excitability tests in normal controls divided into three age groups and in patients with diabetic neuropathy, which were recorded at three target levels (10\%, 40\%, and 60\% of the maximum motor response amplitudes). In all the control groups, tracking at low target level shows smaller threshold change by hyperpolarizing stimuli and greater threshold change by depolarizing stimuli, suggestive of greater transient Na+ current. Normal elderly showed greater threshold change by hyperpolarizing pulse than younger subjects at high target level, likely reflecting decrease of axon diameters. Patients with diabetic neuropathy showed smaller threshold changes by both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing pulses (“fanning-in”), more noticeably at the lower target level, suggestive of the combined effects of membrane depolarization and greater decrease of axonal diameters in smaller fibers. Given the reported unpredictable electrical recruitment order in the diseased conditions and difference of nerve excitability measures in threshold electrotonus at different target levels, comparing threshold electrotonus values between normal and diseased axons may be problematic by comparing axons with different nerve excitability characteristics.},

	abstract = {The mechanisms underlying spinal shock have not been clearly defined. At present, clinical assessment remains the mainstay to describe progression through spinal shock following traumatic spinal cord injury. However, nerve excitability studies in combination with conventional nerve conduction and clinical assessments have the potential to investigate spinal shock at the level of the peripheral axon. Therefore, peripheral motor axon excitability was prospectively and systematically evaluated in more than 400 studies of 11 patients admitted to hospital after traumatic spinal cord injury, with cord lesions above T9 (nine cervical, two thoracic). Recordings commenced within 15 days of admission from the median nerve to abductor pollicis brevis in the upper limb and the common peroneal nerve to tibialis anterior in both lower limbs, and were continued until patient discharge from hospital. Excitability was assessed using threshold tracking techniques and recordings were compared with data from healthy controls. In addition, concurrent clinical measures of strength, serum electrolytes and nerve conduction were collected. High threshold stimulus–response relationships were apparent from the early phase of spinal shock that coincided with depolarization-like features that reached a peak on Day 16.9 (± 2.7 standard error) for the common peroneal nerve and Day 11.8 (± 2.0 standard error) for the median nerve. Overall, changes in the common peroneal nerve were of greater magnitude than for the median nerve. For both nerves, the most significant changes were in threshold electrotonus, which was ‘fanned in’, and during the recovery cycle superexcitability was reduced (P \&lt; 0.001). However, refractoriness was increased only for the common peroneal nerve (P \&lt; 0.05). Changes in the spinal injured cohort could not be explained on the basis of an isolated common peroneal nerve palsy. By the time patients with spinal injury were discharged from hospital between Days 68 and 215, excitability for upper and lower limbs had returned towards normative values, but not for all parameters. Electrolyte levels and results for nerve conduction studies remained within normal limits throughout the period of admission. Contrary to prevailing opinion, these data demonstrate that significant changes in peripheral motor axonal excitability occur early during spinal shock, with subsequent further deterioration in axonal function, before recovery ensues.},

To investigate the changes in motor axonal excitability properties in cervical spondylotic amyotrophy (CSA).
Methods
Threshold tracking was used to measure the median motor axons in 21 patients with CSA, 10 patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy (CSR) and 16 normal controls.
Results
Compared with normal controls, patients with distal-type CSA showed increased threshold electrotonus hyperpolarization (TEh [90–100]) and increased superexcitability on the symptomatic side (P {\textless} 0.05), which are suggestive of distal motor axonal hyperpolarization, presumably due to motor axonal regeneration. More importantly, compared with normal controls and CSR cases, both distal- and proximal-type CSA cases showed lower accommodation during depolarising currents (reduced S2 accommodation, decreased TEd [undershoot] and/or lower subexcitability) (P {\textless} 0.05), indicating that slow K+ conductance may be less active in motor axons in patients with CSA.
Conclusions
The present study demonstrated changes in motor axonal excitability in patients with CSA compared with both normal controls and patients with CSR.
Significance
Less expression of slow K+ conductance may confer greater instability in membrane potential in CSA, thereby presumably contributing to the increased vulnerability of motor axons in patients with CSA.},

	abstract = {Objective
Threshold tracking allows the non-invasive assessment of axonal excitability. This study aimed to determine whether axonal excitability of the motor axons of the median nerve (to APB) and ulnar nerve (to ADM) to the small muscles of the hands is sufficiently similar to be interchangeable; confirm the feasibility and reproducibility of ulnar studies and obtain control data for a young population for this site of stimulation.
Methods
Twenty normal subjects between the ages of 23–43 were studied using the TRONDF protocol of QTRACS, (©Prof Hugh Bostock, London). The median and ulnar nerves were stimulated at the wrist and the compound muscle action potentials were recorded from abductor pollicis brevis and abductor digiti minimi, respectively. Repeat studies were performed in four subjects to confirm reproducibility of the recordings.
Results
Stimulus intensity was greater and strength duration time constant was longer for the median nerve. Threshold electrotonus showed there was a greater change in threshold in the hyperpolarising direction for the median nerve compared with the ulnar nerve. There was however little difference in the recovery cycle and current threshold relationship.
Conclusions
Although recovery cycles and the current thresholds are similar for APB and ADM, there are definite differences in stimulus threshold, SDTC and threshold electrotonus which question the interchangeability of studies for these two sites.
Significance
This study demonstrates reproducibility of motor axonal excitability studies of the ulnar nerve at the wrist, provides young control data for this site of stimulation and suggests that although certain excitability indices are similar for the median nerve to APB and ulnar nerve to ADM there are definite differences making the interchangeability of the data questionable.},

Methods: We studied 10 subjects with primary amyloidosis using conventional nerve conduction studies and quantitative sensory, autonomic, and axonal excitability testing of median motor and sensory fibers. Results: As expected, subjects with amyloidosis had evidence of small- and large-fiber neuropathy on conventional testing. There was no significant difference in axonal excitability between subjects and controls apart from the stimulus required to activate sensory fibers. Conclusions: Amyloid-related neuropathy does not produce a change in membrane potential as either a primary or secondary event.

Twenty and 40 \% threshold electrotonus curves were found for both groups to follow the same paths, suggesting no significant effect of levobupivacaine on K$^{\textrm{+}}$ channels for either the fastest or relatively slow conducting fibers.

However, according to the results of the recovery cycle protocol yielding the pattern of excitability changes following the impulse, potential deviation was found in the recovery characteristics of Na$^{\textrm{+}}$ channels from the absolute refractory period. Consequently, conduction blockage caused by levobupivacaine may not be due to the passive (capacitive) properties of axon or the conductance of potassium channels but to the decrease in sodium channel conductance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {This study investigated the excitability and accommodative properties of low-threshold human motor axons to test whether these motor axons have greater expression of the persistent Na+ conductance, INaP. Computer-controlled threshold tracking was used to study 22 single motor units and the data were compared with compound motor potentials of various amplitudes recorded in the same experimental session. Detailed comparisons were made between the single units and compound potentials that were 40\% or 5\% of maximal amplitude, the former because this is the compound potential size used in most threshold tracking studies of axonal excitability, the latter because this is the compound potential most likely to be composed entirely of motor axons with low thresholds to electrical recruitment. Measurements were made of the strength–duration relationship, threshold electrotonus, current–voltage relationship, recovery cycle and latent addition. The findings did not support a difference in INaP. Instead they pointed to greater activity of the hyperpolarization-activated inwardly rectifying current (Ih) as the basis for low threshold to electrical recruitment in human motor axons. Computer modelling confirmed this finding, with a doubling of the hyperpolarization-activated conductance proving the best single parameter adjustment to fit the experimental data. We suggest that the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel(s) expressed on human motor axons may be active at rest and contribute to resting membrane potential.},

	abstract = {Background
Excitability studies on normal and diseased human axons in vivo have been greatly enhanced by fast non-invasive threshold-tracking techniques, using surface stimulation and recording. Although sensory axons are often more affected in disease, most studies to date have focussed on motor axons, because of technical difficulties in resolving pathologically small nerve volleys in the presence of noise and stimulus artefact.
New methods
This paper describes techniques for tracking low-amplitude compound action potentials, using a battery-powered, isolated preamplifier of simple construction with high common mode rejection ({\textgreater}125 dB [balanced inputs]) and low noise ({\textless}0.4 μV referred to inputs [shorted]).
Results
We demonstrate the preamplifier’s capability by tracking targets as small as 2 μV for a full range of excitability measurements without the usual distortion due to residual stimulus artefact and without the need for clamping, additional filtering or ensemble averaging.
Comparison with existing methods
In practice, threshold-tracking studies have been unable to study sensory axons when the maximal compound sensory action potential was less than about 15 μV. The techniques and amplifier in the present study allow measurements to be made from nerve with maximal responses less than half that size, and we present three recordings in patients with pathologically small nerve action potentials ≤7 μV.
Conclusions
Based on measurements of stimulus artefact distortion, noise and the performance in experiments, we conclude that the techniques described here will facilitate the study of diseased axons for which the sensory potentials have high thresholds and may be only a few microvolts in amplitude.},

To investigate the underlying pathophysiology, peripheral axonal excitability studies were performed and changes with heating and therapy explored. Multiple excitability indices (stimulus–response curve, strength–duration time constant (SDTC), threshold electrotonus, and recovery cycle) were investigated in 23 (9 EMSCN9A+ and 14 EMSCN9A−) genetically characterized patients with EM stimulating median motor and sensory axons at the wrist. At rest, patients with EM showed a higher threshold and rheobase (P {\textless} 0.001) compared with controls. Threshold electrotonus and current–voltage relationships demonstrated greater changes of thresholds in both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing preconditioning electrotonus in both EM cohorts compared with controls in sensory axons (P {\textless} 0.005). When average temperature was raised from 31.5°C to 36.3°C in EMSCN9A+ patients, excitability changes showed depolarization, specifically SDTC significantly increased, in contrast to the effects of temperature previously established in healthy subjects (P {\textless} 0.05). With treatment, 4 EMSCN9A+ patients (4/9) reported improvement with mexiletine, associated with reduction in SDTC in motor and sensory axons. This is the first study of primary EM using threshold tracking techniques to demonstrate alterations in peripheral axonal membrane function. Taken together, these changes may be attributed to systemic neurovascular abnormalities in EM, with chronic postischaemic resting membrane potential hyperpolarization due to Na+/K+ pump overactivity. With heating, a trigger of acute symptoms, axonal depolarization developed, corresponding to acute axonal ischaemia. This study has provided novel insights into EM pathophysiology.},

Mathematical modeling was used to identify the interval changes of the channel parameters. After administration of BaCl2 and ivabradine, the following changes were present: greater threshold changes of both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing threshold electrotonus by both; additionally, reduced S2 accommodation, reduced late subexcitability and increased superexcitability by BaCl2, increased S3 accommodation by ivabradine.

	abstract = {Objective
To test motor fiber excitability in early affected patients with transthyretin (TTR)-type familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) before and during tafamidis treatment.
Methods
We examined the left median nerve of 21 healthy-matched controls and 10 early affected TTR-FAP patients using the automated threshold-tracking program, QTRAC. TTR-FAP patients were tested one day before the initiation of tafamidis treatment, 3 and 6 months later.
Results
The drug was well-tolerated in all patients; there was no drop-out. No statistical difference was found between healthy controls and TTR-FAP patients at study entry. On treatment, both stimulus intensity for 50\% of the maximal motor response and rheobase increased significantly from entry to the last evaluation at 6 months (P{\textless}0.05). Strength duration time constant decreased significantly from the 3rd to the 6th month of evaluation (P{\textless}0.05). There was also a “fanning-out” effect on the late depolarization phase (TEd 90–100ms) as well as a shortened relative refractory period from study entry to the 6th month of evaluation.
Conclusions
Threshold-tracking of median nerve motor fibers is not a helpful technique for the early diagnosis of TTR-FAP patients. Tafamidis was well-tolerated. We observed possible membrane hyperpolarization during treatment. Threshold tracking can contribute to documenting the action of new drugs to treat neuropathies. Tafamidis may change nerve electrical properties by reducing the burden of amyloid fibrils.},

	abstract = {The objective was to determine biophysical differences between fast and slow motor axons using threshold tracking and demonstrate confounds related to anesthetic. Nerve excitability of motor axons innervating the slow-twitch soleus (SOL) and fast-twitch tibialis anterior (TA) muscles was tested. The experiments were conducted with pentobarbital sodium (SP) anesthetic and compared with previous results that used ketamine-xylazine (KX). Nerve excitability indices measured with SP show definitive differences between TA and SOL motor axons that extend beyond previous reports. Nerve excitability indices sensitive to changes in Ih indicated an increase in SOL axons compared with TA axons [e.g., S3 t = 7.949 (df = 10), P {\textless} 0.001; hyperpolarizing threshold electrotonus (90–100 ms), t = 2.659 (df = 20); P = 0.01; hyperpolarizing I/V slope, t = 4.308 (df = 19); P {\textless} 0.001]. SOL axons also had a longer strength-duration time constant [t = 3.35 (df = 20); P = 0.003] and a longer and larger magnitude relative refractory period [RRP (ms) t = 3.53 (df = 12); P = 0.004; Refractoriness at 2 ms, t = 0.0055 (df = 9); P = 0.006]. Anesthetic choice affected many measures of peripheral nerve excitability with differences most apparent in tests of threshold electrotonus and recovery cycle. For example, recovery cycle with KX lacked a clear superexcitable and late subexcitable period. We conclude that KX had a confounding effect on nerve excitability results consistent with ischemic depolarization. Results using SP revealed the full extent of differences in nerve excitability measures between putative slow and fast motor axons of the rat. These results provide empirical evidence, beyond conduction velocity, that the biophysical properties of motor axons vary with the type of muscle fiber innervated. These differences suggest that fast axons may be predisposed to dysfunction during hyperpolarizing stresses, e.g., electrogenic sodium pumping following sustained impulse conduction., NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Nerve excitability testing is a tool used to provide insight into the properties of ion channels in peripheral nerves. It is used clinically to assess pathophysiology of axons. Researchers customarily think of motor axons as homogeneous; however, we demonstrate there are clear differences between fast and slow axons in the rat. This is important for interpreting results with selective motor neuronopathy, like aging where fast axons are at high risk of degeneration.},

	abstract = {1. We have previously studied accommodation in rat and human motor axons by testing excitability with combinations of long and short current pulses. We found that normally polarized axons accommodate slowly and partially (over about 50 ms) to subthreshold depolarizing currents, and that the principal mechanism is the activation of slow potassium channels (Bostock \& Baker, 1988). To understand the response of human nerves to ischaemia, we have now extended these observations to axons already depolarized before the testing currents were applied. 2. Rat ventral root axons were depolarized by passing continuous currents or by raising the extracellular potassium concentration. Human forearm nerves were depolarized by ischaemia, induced by inflating a sphygmomanometer cuff on the upper arm. Depolarized rat and human motor axons accommodated much more rapidly and completely than normally polarized axons (e.g. accommodation in rat axons was 50\% complete within 2 ms at about 15 mV depolarized to rest). 3. The fast component of accommodation in depolarized rat fibres was not blocked by tetraethylammonium ions or 4-aminopyridine, was not accompanied by a conductance or potential change, and had a time constant of 1.7 ms at 30 degrees C. It was attributed to inactivation of closed sodium channels. 4. In depolarized rat fibres exhibiting fast accommodation, a brief rise in excitability was seen at the break of an anodal current. Our prediction that human motor axons would show anode-break excitation during ischaemia was readily confirmed. 5. The results are discussed in relation to Hill's (1936) mathematical description of accommodation in nerve, and it is concluded that his description is only applicable to depolarized axons.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES To investigate whether accommodation to depolarising and hyperpolarising currents differs for motor axons of human upper and lower limb nerves.
METHODS The threshold tracking technique was used to measure threshold electrotonus for median and peroneal motor axons. The threshold current that produced a compound muscle action potential 50\% of maximum was measured, and membrane potential was altered using subthreshold polarising currents of 330 ms duration but of variable intensity, from +40\% (depolarising) to –100\% (hyperpolarising) of the unconditioned threshold.
RESULTS The maximal threshold changes (the peak of the S1 phase of threshold electrotonus) were significantly greater in median axons for both depolarising and hyperpolarising currents. The subsequent phases of accommodation to depolarising currents (S2) and to hyperpolarising currents (S3) were also significantly greater in median axons. These findings raised the possibility that greater accommodation (S2 and S3) in median axons resulted from greater changes in membrane potential. However, regression of S2 against S1 to depolarising currents disclosed significantly greater accommodation (27.8\%) for median axons, suggesting that slow K+ conductances may be more prominent on median than peroneal axons. By contrast, the relation between S3 and S1 to hyperpolarising currents was similar for the two nerves, suggesting that the difference in inward rectification was merely because the conductance varies with the extent of hyperpolarisation.
CONCLUSIONS Slow K+ conductances are more prominent for median motor axons than for peroneal axons. It would therefore be expected that axons innervating the lower limbs have less protection from depolarising stress and could develop ectopic activity more readily.},

The protocol measures stimulus–response behavior using two stimulus durations (from which the distribution of strength–duration time constants is estimated), threshold electrotonus to 100 ms polarizing currents, a current–threshold relationship (indicating inward and outward rectification), and the recovery of excitability following supramaximal activation. The method was tested on 50 healthy volunteers, stimulating the median nerve at the wrist and recording the antidromic compound sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) from digit 2. The excitability measurements were similar, where comparisons were possible, with published sensory nerve data, and confirmed differences from motor nerves, particularly in strength–duration behavior and recovery cycle, likely to reflect functional differences between sensory and motor nerves. Although slower than for motor nerves, the sensory nerve recordings were sufficiently quick (16 to 18 min) to allow them to be included in routine clinical studies. We propose that this method, which provides quite different and complementary information about nerve function to conventional conduction studies, provides a useful new approach for exploring the pathophysiology of sensory neuropathies. © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

To test this idea, we have compared the threshold changes produced by long-lasting (100–200 ms) de- and hyperpolarizing currents applied to median motor and sensory axons at the wrist in 63 diabetic patients with those from 50 normal controls and 27 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. Averages of the threshold electrotonus plots for motor and sensory axons of diabetic patients showed more subexcitability during, and slower recovery following, the application of hyperpolarizing currents. Such alterations have been previously found in isolated rat nerves after inhibition of axonal inward rectification by means of cesium ions. The abnormalities in diabetics were positively correlated with the age of patients and the presence of neuropathy. Threshold electrotonus seen in diabetes differed strongly from the effects of acute ischemia and were unlike changes recorded in ALS. The data indicate that an abnormal inward rectification of peripheral axons is associated with diabetic neuropathy.

	abstract = {In order to explore the pathophysiology of diabetic neuropathy, we studied serial changes of axonal excitability in 20 adult Wistar rats with streptozocin-induced diabetes using the technique of threshold electrotonus (TE). After persistent hyperglycaemia had developed, rats were divided into two groups: nine were fed a diet containing aldose reductase inhibitor (Epalrestat 30 mg/kg/day) (ARI+ group) and 11 were fed a diet without the inhibitor (ARI– group). Eight normal control rats of similar age (NC group) were also studied. We monitored membrane properties of motor axons in the tail for 3 months using TE to measure the changes in excitability induced by subthreshold polarizing currents while recording compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) in the tail muscle. The ARI– group showed a significant increase in CMAP latency 1 month after streptozocin injection, and by 3 months there was significantly lower excitability after hyperpolarization for 100 ms compared with the NC group. A similar change in TE was reproduced by injection of caesium chloride, an inhibitor of inward rectification. By contrast, the ARI+ group exhibited no significant change in TE or latency at 3 months, although they showed significant body weight loss and hyperglycaemia. These findings indicate that inward rectification is reduced in an experimental model, as in human diabetes, and that blocking the polyol pathway with an ARI prevents this reduction. Reduced inward rectification potentiates conduction block caused by activity-dependent hyperpolarization and may underlie the decreased vibratory sensation seen in the early stage of diabetic neuropathy.},

However, it is still challenging to characterise the electrical characteristics of axons in small fibres (Aδ and C fibres). Particularly, in vitro measurement for human Aδ fibre is difficult due to the presence of myelin and ethical reason. In this study, we investigate the in vivo electrical characteristics of the human Aδ fibre to derive strength-duration (S-D) curves from the measurement. The Aδ fibres are stimulated using coaxial planar electrodes with intraepidermal needle tip. For human volunteer experiments, the S-D curve of Aδ fibre is obtained in terms of injected electrical current. With the computational analysis, the standard deviation of the S-D curve is mostly attributed to the thickness of the stratum corneum and depth of the needle tip, in addition to the fibre thickness. Then, we derive electrical parameters of the axon in the Aδ fibre based on a conventional fibre model. The parameters derived here would be important in exploring the optimal stimulation condition of Aδ fibres.},

Methods CPT measurement was repeated on two separate days with at least one-week interval in 55 volunteers. Superficial blood flow (SBF) and skin temperature (ST) were measured on the skin in an around area concentric to the circular pin electrodes after the process of finding CPTs. The coefficient of variation (CV) and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) were calculated. The correlation between each two of CPT, SBF increment and ST increment was analyzed. Results No significant differences were found for CPT, SBF and ST between two sessions. SBF was found to be significantly increased after the process of finding CPT. CPT values of males were found to be higher than females. SBF increment was found to be positively correlated with ST increment. The ICC values for CPT, SBF and ST were 0.595, 0.852 and 0.728, respectively. The CV values for CPT, SBF and ST were 25.53\%, 12.59\% and 1.94\%, respectively.

	abstract = {Aim Short periods of muscle disuse, due to illness or injury, result in substantial skeletal muscle atrophy. Recently, we have shown that a single session of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) increases muscle protein synthesis rates. The aim was to investigate the capacity for daily NMES to attenuate muscle atrophy during short-term muscle disuse. Methods Twenty-four healthy, young (23 ± 1 year) males participated in the present study. Volunteers were subjected to 5 days of one-legged knee immobilization with (NMES; n = 12) or without (CON; n = 12) supervised NMES sessions (40-min sessions, twice daily). Two days prior to and immediately after the immobilization period, CT scans and single-leg one-repetition maximum (1RM) strength tests were performed to assess quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and leg muscle strength respectively. Furthermore, muscle biopsies were taken to assess muscle fibre CSA, satellite cell content and mRNA and protein expression of selected genes. Results In CON, immobilization reduced quadriceps CSA by 3.5 ± 0.5\% (P {\textless} 0.0001) and muscle strength by 9 ± 2\% (P {\textless} 0.05). In contrast, no significant muscle loss was detected following immobilization in NMES although strength declined by 7 ± 3\% (P {\textless} 0.05). Muscle MAFbx and MuRF1 mRNA expression increased following immobilization in CON (P {\textless} 0.001 and P = 0.07 respectively), whereas levels either declined (P {\textless} 0.01) or did not change in NMES, respectively. Immobilization led to an increase in muscle myostatin mRNA expression in CON (P {\textless} 0.05), but remained unchanged in NMES. Conclusion During short-term disuse, NMES represents an effective interventional strategy to prevent the loss of muscle mass, but it does not allow preservation of muscle strength. NMES during disuse may be of important clinical relevance in both health and disease.},

	abstract = {Background
It remains unknown if inactivity changes the mechanical properties of the human patellar tendon in younger and older healthy persons. The purpose was to examine the effects of short-term unilateral immobilization on the structural and mechanical properties of the patellar tendon in older men and younger men, in vivo.
Methods
Eight older men and eight younger men underwent 14days of unilateral immobilization. All individuals were assessed on both sides before and after the intervention. MRI was used to assess whole patellar tendon dimensions. The mechanical properties of the patellar tendon were assessed using simultaneous force and ultrasonographic measurements during isometric ramp contractions.
Findings
In older men, tendon stiffness [Pre: mean 2949 (SD 799) vs. Post: mean 2366 (SD 774) Nmm−1, P{\textless}0.01] and Young's Modulus [Pre: mean 1.2 (SD 0.3) vs. Post: mean 1.0 (SD 0.3) GPa, P{\textless}0.05] declined with immobilization on the immobilized side. On the control side, tendon stiffness [Pre: mean 3340 (SD 1209) vs. Post: mean 2230 (SD 503), P{\textless}0.01] and Young's Modulus [Pre: mean 1.5 (SD 0.4) vs. Post: mean 0.9 (SD 0.3) GPa, P{\textless}0.05] also decreased with immobilization. In younger men, tendon stiffness [Pre: 3622 (SD 1760) vs. Post: mean 2910 (SD 1528) Nmm−1, P{\textless}0.01] and Young's Modulus [Pre: mean 1.7 (SD 1.1) vs. Post: mean 1.4 (SD 0.8) GPa, P{\textless}0.05] decreased only on the immobilized side.
Interpretation
Short-term immobilization led to impaired mechanical properties of the patellar tendon on the immobilized side in both younger men and older men, which can influence the function of the muscle–tendon complex.},

Two-fold study setting: prospective longitudinal and cross-sectional single-blind.
A total of 118 patients in the intensive care unit (length of stay 1-98 days; male:female ratio 88:30; age 55 +/- 17 years) were included in a two-fold study setting.
Muscle layer thickness of the M. quadriceps femoris was documented using ultrasound measurement at well-defined points. Seventeen pilot-patients were measured twice; at baseline and after 28 days. In another group of 101 patients, muscle layer thickness was determined once after a random length of stay. The results of both groups were compared and correlated.
In both groups, M. quadriceps femoris thickness showed a significant negative correlation with length of stay in the intensive care unit (p {\textless} 0.01). Furthermore, muscle wasting in intensive care patients could be described using a logarithmic function.
Loss of muscle mass shows a negative correlation with length of stay, and seems to be higher during the first 2-3 weeks of immobilization/intensive care unit stay.

	abstract = {Survivors of critical illness demonstrate skeletal muscle wasting with associated functional impairment.To perform a comprehensive prospective characterization of skeletal muscle wasting, defining the pathogenic roles of altered protein synthesis and breakdown.Sixty-three critically ill patients (59\% male; mean age: 54.7 years [95\% CI, 50.0-59.6 years]) with an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 23.5 (95\% CI, 21.9-25.2) were prospectively recruited within 24 hours following intensive care unit (ICU) admission from August 2009 to April 2011 at a university teaching and a community hospital in England. Patients were recruited if older than 18 years and were anticipated to be intubated for longer than 48 hours, to spend more than 7 days in critical care, and to survive ICU stay.Muscle loss was determined through serial ultrasound measurement of the rectus femoris cross-sectional area (CSA) on days 1, 3, 7, and 10. In a subset of patients, the fiber CSA area was quantified along with the ratio of protein to DNA on days 1 and 7. Histopathological analysis was performed. In addition, muscle protein synthesis, breakdown rates, and respective signaling pathways were characterized.There were significant reductions in the rectus femoris CSA observed at day 10 (−17.7\% [95\% CI, −20.9\% to −4.8\%]; P \&lt; .001). In the 28 patients assessed by all 3 measurement methods on days 1 and 7, the rectus femoris CSA decreased by 10.3\% (95\% CI, 6.1\% to 14.5\%), the fiber CSA by 17.5\% (95\% CI, 5.8\% to 29.3\%), and the ratio of protein to DNA by 29.5\% (95\% CI, 13.4\% to 45.6\%). Decrease in the rectus femoris CSA was greater in patients who experienced multiorgan failure compared with single organ failure by day 7 (−15.7\% [95\% CI, −19.1\% to −12.4\%] vs −3.0\% [95\% CI, −10.5\% to 4.6\%], P \&lt; .001), even by day 3 (−8.7\% [95\% CI, −13.7\% to −3.6\%] vs −1.8\% [95\% CI, −7.3\% to 3.8\%], respectively; P = .03). Myofiber necrosis occurred in 20 of 37 patients (54.1\%). Protein synthesis measured by the muscle protein fractional synthetic rate was depressed in patients on day 1 (0.035\%/hour; 95\% CI, 0.023\% to 0.047\%/hour) compared with rates observed in fasted healthy controls (0.039\%/hour; 95\% CI, 0.029\% to 0.048\%/hour) (P = .57) and increased by day 7 (0.076\% [95\% CI, 0.032\%-0.120\%/hour]; P = .03) to rates associated with fed controls (0.065\%/hour [95\% CI, 0.049\% to 0.080\%/hour]; P = .30), independent of nutritional load. Leg protein breakdown remained elevated throughout the study (8.5 [95\% CI, 4.7 to 12.3] to 10.6 [95\% CI, 6.8 to 14.4] μmol of phenylalanine/min/ideal body weight × 100; P = .40). The pattern of intracellular signaling supported increased breakdown (n = 9, r = −0.83, P = .005) and decreased synthesis (n = 9, r = −0.69, P = .04).Among these critically ill patients, muscle wasting occurred early and rapidly during the first week of critical illness and was more severe among those with multiorgan failure compared with single organ failure.

	abstract = {The present narrative review addresses issues concerning the defining criteria and conceptual underpinnings of pain catastrophizing. To date, the concept of pain catastrophizing has been extensively used in many clinical and experimental contexts and it is considered as one of the most important psychological correlate of pain chronicity and disability. Although its extensive use, we are still facing important problems related to its defining criteria and conceptual understanding. At present, there is no general theoretical agreement of what catastrophizing really is. The lack of a consensus on its definition and conceptual issues has important consequences on the choice of the pain management approaches, defining and identifying problems, and promoting novel research. Clinical and research work in absence of a common theoretical ground is often trivial. It is very surprising that clinical and experimental work has grown extensively in the past years, without a common ground in the form of a clear definition of pain catastrophizing and overview of its conceptual basis. Improving the efficacy and efficiency of pan catastrophizing related treatments requires an understanding of the theoretical construct. So far, most interventions have only demonstrated modest effects in reducing pain catastrophizing. Therefore, clarifying the construct may be an important precursor for developing more targeted and effective interventions, thereby easing some of the burden related to this aspect of pain. In our review, we have extracted and de-constructed common elements that emerge from different theoretical models with the aim to understand the concept of catastrophizing, which components can be modulated by psychological interventions, and the general role in pain processing. The analysis of the literature has indicated essential key elements to explain pain catastrophizing: emotional regulation, catastrophic worry (as repetitive negative thinking), rumination, behavioral inhibition and behavioral activation (BIS/BAS) systems, and interoceptive sensitivity. The present paper attempts to integrate these key elements with the aim to re-compose and unify the concept within a modern biopsychosocial interpretation of catastrophizing.},

	abstract = {Action potential initiation and conduction along peripheral axons is a dynamic process that displays pronounced activity dependence. In patients with neuropathic pain, differences in the modulation of axonal conduction velocity by activity suggest that this property may provide insight into some of the pathomechanisms. To date, direct recordings of axonal membrane potential have been hampered by the small diameter of the fibers. We have therefore adopted an alternative approach to examine the basis of activity-dependent changes in axonal conduction by constructing a comprehensive mathematical model of human cutaneous C-fibers. Our model reproduced axonal spike propagation at a velocity of 0.69 m/s commensurate with recordings from human C-nociceptors. Activity-dependent slowing (ADS) of axonal propagation velocity was adequately simulated by the model. Interestingly, the property most readily associated with ADS was an increase in the concentration of intra-axonal sodium. This affected the driving potential of sodium currents, thereby producing latency changes comparable to those observed for experimental ADS. The model also adequately reproduced post-action potential excitability changes (i.e., recovery cycles) observed in vivo. We performed a series of control experiments replicating blockade of particular ion channels as well as changing temperature and extracellular ion concentrations. In the absence of direct experimental approaches, the model allows specific hypotheses to be formulated regarding the mechanisms underlying activity-dependent changes in C-fiber conduction. Because ADS might functionally act as a negative feedback to limit trains of nociceptor activity, we envisage that identifying its mechanisms may also direct efforts aimed at alleviating neuronal hyperexcitability in pain patients.},

	abstract = {Our first aim was to characterize spontaneous motor unit activity in thenar muscles influenced by chronic cervical spinal cord injury. Thenar surface electromyography (EMG), intramuscular EMG, and abduction and flexion forces were recorded. Subjects were instructed to relax for 2 min. Units still firing after 10 s were considered spontaneously active. Two distinct patterns of spontaneous unit activity were recorded. Units either fired tonically at a mean frequency of 6.1 HZ or were active sporadically (2.2 HZ). Stimuli (e.g., light touch of nearby skin) were then used to influence tonic spontaneous unit activity. Most stimuli produced a change in firing frequency, usually a temporary increase, but sometimes unit frequency decreased or new activity was initiated. Inputs to these motoneurons clearly make important contributions to changes in unit activity. However, the difficulty that subjects had in stopping unit activity, and the initiation of activity when subjects relaxed, suggest that the source of spontaneity may be the motoneuron itself. © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

	abstract = {Membrane electrical properties [time constant, action potential afterhyperpolarization (AHP), rheobase, input resistance, and axonal conduction velocity] were measured in motoneurons of cat medial gastrocnemius (MG) motor units. Motor units were classified on the basis of their mechanical responses as fast twitch, fast fatiguing (FF); fast twitch with intermediate fatigue resistance (FI); fast twitch, fatigue resistant (FR); or slow twitch, fatigue resistant (S; 11, 22). Motoneuron membrane time constant, estimated from the voltage response at the onset or termination of long (50-100 ms) current pulses and corrected for voltage-response nonlinearities (32), was found to differ significantly among the major motor-unit types, increasing in the order FF less than FR less than S. Afterhyperpolarization magnitude, half-decay time, and duration were all significantly greater for the fast (FF + FI + FR) versus the slow (S) motor units. The AHP half-decay time was correlated with muscle unit twitch time over the entire motoneuron population and within the type S motor-unit population. There was no significant correlation between twitch time and AHP half-decay time among the types FF and FR motor-unit populations. In agreement with previous studies, we found a significant difference in both rheobase and input resistance among the major motor-unit types, with rheobase increasing in the order S less than FR less than FF and input resistance decreasing in that order (S greater than FR greater than FF). The differences in input resistance were present both before and after correcting for voltage-response nonlinearities (32). Also in agreement with previous studies, the mean axonal conduction velocity was significantly faster among the fast (FF + FI + and FR) compared with the slow (S) motor units. These data were used to examine the properties alone to determine motor-unit type, which has traditionally been defined on the basis of the muscle unit's mechanical properties (11, 22). We used a discriminant analysis program to classify 73 mechanically typed motor units for which we had measures of rheobase, input resistance, membrane time constant, and AHP half-decay time. This model was able to properly classify 71 of the 73 motor units of this data set, indicating that the motor units of this data set could be grouped into three categories representing the three major motor-unit types (FF, FR, and S) on the basis of their rheobase, input resistance, membrane time constant, and AHP half-decay time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {A strict interpretation of the size-principle hypothesis (37, 39-41) is that a muscle's motor units should be recruited in an ascending order according to both the size of their motoneurons and the size of their innervated muscle units (for reviews see Refs. 9, 39, 73). Studies of large mixed muscles in the cat hindlimb, however, have shown that motor axonal conduction velocity and tetanic tension, which are frequently considered indices of motoneuron and muscle-unit size, respectively, are uncorrelated in the fast-twitch (type F) motor-unit subpopulation (12, 13, 23, 24, 30, 32, 63, 71, 79). Attempting to focus on type F units, we compared the recruitment order of 42 pairs of cat plantaris (PL) motor units with both axonal conduction velocity and tetanic tension as well as with other muscle-unit properties. Single PL alpha-motor axons were functionally isolated in intact L7 ventral root filaments of decerebrate cats. Tension responses produced by stimulating each isolated motor axon were used to find the tetanic tension of the muscle unit and to classify the unit (12) as either type S (slow twitch, fatigue resistant), type FR (fast twitch, fatigue resistant), type FI (fast twitch, intermediate fatigability), or type FF (fast twitch, highly fatigable). Conduction velocity of each isolated axon was computed from measurements of axonal conduction time and length. The axon's reflex discharges were recorded from the proximal end of the cut filament and compared with the discharges of another PL axon residing in a different, previously cut filament of the same cat. The recruitment order of each motor-unit pair studied was found during reflexes elicited by homonymous muscle stretch, tendon taps, or single shocks at group I intensity to the PL nerve. If either axon of the pair failed to discharge, as often was the case with the high-threshold type F units, the monosynaptic reflex was facilitated by a 500-pps conditioning train applied proximal to a complete reversible cooling block of the PL nerve. In all 42 pairs studied, the weaker motor unit had the lower functional threshold for recruitment. Recruitment also invariably followed the order S greater than FR greater than FI greater than FF units. The motor unit of a pair with the higher resistance to fatigue thus always had the lower functional threshold. In 21 of the 22 pairs containing at least one type S motor unit, the unit with the slower-conducting motor axon had the lower functional threshold for recruitment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {The number of motor units in the thenar muscle group was estimated in 11 patients with cervical spinal cord injuries. The surface electromyogram and twitch force, in response to maximal stimulation of the median nerve was divided by the average surface electromyogram and twitch of single units. The average single unit size was obtained by intramuscular microstimulation of motor nerve branches and by graded whole nerve stimulation, which provided three independent estimates, two based on the electromyogram and one based on force. The motor unit estimates from the patients covered a wide range, some had essentially normal motor units both in numbers and contracatile properties, while others had varying reductions in numbers of units. Those patients who showed a large reduction in motor unit numbers also had greatly enlarged units, which produced an average of up to sixfold the normal force. These enlarged units summed to produce maximal compound action potentials and twitches that were sometimes indistinguishable from normal. Magnetic resonance imaging scans of the cervical spine obtained from some patients provided independent evidence that patients with low motor unit counts had sustained direct injury to the anterior aspect of the spinal cord at the relevant segmental levels. Some patients showed a normal number of motor units long after the injury. No evidence of transneuronal degeneration could be demonstrated in the thenar group in these patients with the current techniques.},

The results confirmed the known effect of inter-electrode spacing and bipolar and tripolar recording configuration on the AP amplitude. It also demonstrates a crossover point where the amplitude of the tripolar recording is larger than the monopolar recording, an effect of the slower action potential conduction velocities in the worm. The delay adder was found to be an effective velocity sensitive filter, able to discriminate units based on conduction velocity. The matched filter to be an effective means to eliminate artifact and increase signal to noise ratios, however was not found to improve selectivity.},

	abstract = {Microneurography and the use of selective microelectrodes that can resolve single-unit nerve activity have become a tool to understand the coding within the nervous system and a clinical diagnostic tool to assess peripheral neural pathologies. Central to these techniques is the use of the differences in the shape of the extracellular action potential (AP) waveform to identify and discriminate units from one another. Theoretical modeling of the origins of these shape differences has shown that the position of the nerve fiber relative to the electrode and the conduction velocity of the unit contribute to these differences giving rise to the hypothesis that more information about the fiber and its relationship to the electrode could be extracted given further analysis of the AP waveform. This paper addresses this question by exploring the electrical coupling between the electrode and nerve fiber. Idealized models and the literature indicate that two parameters, the electrode–fiber distance and the unit conduction velocity, contribute to the amplitude of the extracellular AP detected by the electrode, which confounds the quantification of coupling using the spike amplitude alone. To resolve this, we develop a method that enables differential quantification of these two parameters using spectral analysis of the single-unit AP waveform and demonstrate that the two parameters could be effectively decoupled in an in vitro earthworm model. The method could open the way forward toward micro-scale in situ monitoring of the interaction of nerve fiber and neural interface.},

The fine structure of the dorsal nodes (DN) resembles in many aspects the Ranvier nodes in vertebrate and crustacean nerve fibers. The nodal membrane directly faces the extracellular collagenous capsule of the ventral cord and displays a conspicuous electrondense undercoat. The myelin sheath of the paranode shows a characteristic differentiation into large desmosomal contacts. Recordings of the transmembrane and longitudinal surface currents along the dorsal side of the MGF during spike propagation support the view that an active inward current is restricted there to the DN. The inward current density in the DN reaches outstandingly high values similar to those measured in vertebrate nodes of Ranvier. The nodal activity can be blocked by application of tetrodotoxin and local anaesthetics. Local electrical stimulation of only one DN may suffice to elicit propagated actions potentials up and down the MGF. It is concluded that the dorsal nodes of the median giant fiber of the earthworm are highly specialized excitable structures mediating saltatory impulse conduction in these fibers.},

None of the nerve trunks of the body was observed to send branches to more than one segment, which shows that they are segmental in origin and distribution. The anterior portion of the central nervous system has undergone caudal migration and modification of its ganglia. Some of the nerve trunks have disappeared through atrophy, while others have become fused at their bases. A subepidermal nerve plexus is found at the base of the epidermal cells from which nerve fibers pass to the internal nerve net and to the central nervous system. This plexus also sends intercellular and intracellular fibers into the epidermis. The so-called sense cells of the epidermis appear to be the cell bodies of sensory neurones which send nerve fibers to the ganglia of the central nervous system, where they form synaptic connections with other neurones. There is an enteric nerve plexus in the wall of the alimentary canal which is directly connected to the circumpharyngeal connectives.},

The giant axon is surrounded by a Schwannian sheath in which the lamellae are arranged spirally. They can be traced from the outer surface of the Schwann cell to the axon-Schwann membranes. Irregularities in the spiral arrangement are frequently observed. Desmosome-like attachment areas occur on the giant fiber nerve sheath. These structures appear to be arranged bilaterally in columns which are oriented slightly obliquely to the long axis of the giant fiber and aligned linearly from the axon to the periphery of the sheath. At these sites they bind together apposing portions of Schwann cell membrane comprising the sheath. Longitudinal or oblique sections of the nerve sheath attachment areas are reminiscent of the Schmidt-Lantermann clefts of vertebrate peripheral nerve. Septa of the giant fibers have been examined. They are symmetrical or non-polarized and consist of the two plasma membranes of adjacent nerve units. Characteristic vesicular and tubular structures are associated with both cytoplasmic surfaces of these septa.},

	abstract = {1. A method is described for measuring contractile properties of single human motor units. Conventional human microneurographic techniques were adapted to stimulate individual motor axons in the median nerve, with the use of negative current pulses and a tungsten microelectrode, while recording motor-unit electromyographic activity (EMG) and isometric force responses from the thenar muscles. 2. EMG signals were recorded from both proximal and distal thenar muscle surfaces. Force was recorded in two directions (thumb flexion and abduction). This allowed calculation of the direction and magnitude of resultant force exerted by each unit. 3. Data accepted as originating from a single unit satisfied all the traditional "all-or-none" criteria. Additional criteria also required the following: 1) a wide safety margin between the threshold for unit activation and the current intensity needed to elicit responses from other units; 2) that the characteristic direction in which each unit generated force did not change during the recording period; and 3) whenever F-responses were encountered, the second EMG waveform was identical to the first--a highly improbable event if more than one unit had been excited. 4. Respiration and blood pressure waves introduced baseline fluctuations that distorted the force measurements. These fluctuations were minimized by synchronizing stimuli to the pulse pressure cycle and resetting the baseline electronically just before stimulus onset. 5. Combining motor-axon stimulation at a site remote from the muscle with electronic resetting of the force baseline and delivery of stimuli at fixed intervals after the pulse pressure waves allowed the full time course of human motor-unit twitch and tetanic force and EMG signals to be recorded accurately without signal averaging.},

Fine tuning of only a few, not well-established parameters was performed by fitting the shape of a propagating action potential and its diameter-dependent propagation velocity. The quantitative behaviour of this model corresponds better to experimentally determined human fibre properties than other mammalian, non-human models do. Typical characteristics, such as the shape of the action potential, the propagation velocity and the strength-duration behaviour show a good fit with experimental data. The introduced diameter-dependent parameters did not result in a noticeable diameter dependency of action potential duration and refractory period. The presented model provides an improved tool to analyse the electrical behaviour of human myelinated sensory nerve fibres.},

	abstract = {Accurate, noninvasive determination of the distribution of conduction velocities (DCV) among fibers of a peripheral nerve has the potential to improve both clinical diagnoses of pathology and longitudinal studies of the progress of disease or the efficacy of treatments. Current techniques rely on long distances of propagation to increase the amount of temporal dispersion in the compound signals and reduce the relative effect of errors in the forward model. The method described in this paper attempts to reduce errors in DCV estimation through transfer function normalization and, thereby, eliminate the need for long segments of nerve. Compound action potential (CAP) signals are recorded from several, equally spaced electrodes in an array spanning only a 10-cm length of nerve. Relative nerve-to-electrode transfer functions (NETFs) between the nerve and each of the array electrodes are estimated by comparing discrete Fourier transforms of the array signals. NETFs are normalized along the array so that waveform differences can be attributed to the effects of temporal dispersion between recordings, and more accurate DCV estimates can be calculated from the short nerve segment. The method is tested using simulated and real CAP data. DCV estimates are improved for simulated signals. The normalization procedure results in DCVs that qualitatively match those from the literature when used on actual CAP recordings.},

	abstract = {Although classical neurophysiological doctrine rested on the concept of the sodium channel, it is now clear that there are nearly a dozen sodium channel genes, each encoding a molecularly distinct channel. Different repertoires of channels endow different types of neurons with distinct transduction and encoding properties. Sodium channel expression is highly dynamic, exhibiting plasticity at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In some types of neurons within the normal nervous system, e.g. hypothalamic magnocellular neurosecretory neurons, changes in sodium channel gene expression occur in association with the transition from a quiescent to a bursting state; these changes are accompanied by the insertion of a different set of sodium channel subtypes in the cell membrane, a form of molecular plasticity which results in altered electrogenic properties. Dysregulation of sodium channel genes has been observed in a number of disease states. For example, transection of the peripheral axons of spinal sensory neurons triggers down-regulation of some sodium channel genes, and up-regulation of other sodium channel genes; the resultant changes in sodium channel expression contribute to hyperexcitability that can lead to chronic pain. There is also evidence, in experimental models of demyelination and in post-mortem tissue from patients with multiple sclerosis, for dysregulation of sodium channel gene expression in the cell bodies of some neurons whose axons have been demyelinated, suggesting that an acquired channelopathy may contribute to the pathophysiology of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. The dynamic nature of sodium channel gene expression makes it a complex topic for investigation, but it also introduces therapeutic opportunities, since subtype-specific sodium channel modulating drugs may soon be available.},

	abstract = {Following nerve injury, primary sensory neurons (dorsal root ganglion [DRG] neurons, trigeminal neurons) exhibit a variety of electrophysiological abnormalities, including increased baseline sensitivity and/or hyperexcitability, which can lead to abnormal burst activity that underlies pain, but the molecular basis for these changes has not been fully understood. Over the past several years, it has become clear that nearly a dozen distinct sodium channels are encoded by different genes and that at least six of these (including at least three distinct DRG- and trigeminal neuron–specific sodium channels) are expressed in primary sensory neurons. The deployment of different types of sodium channels in different types of DRG neurons endows them with different physiological properties. Dramatic changes in sodium channel expression, including downregulation of the SNS/PN3 and NaN sodium channel genes and upregulation of previously silent type III sodium channel gene, occur in DRG neurons following axonal transection. These changes in sodium channel gene expression are accompanied by a reduction in tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant sodium currents and by the emergence of a TTX-sensitive sodium current which recovers from inactivation (reprimes) four times more rapidly than the channels in normal DRG neurons. These changes in sodium channel expression poise DRG neurons to fire spontaneously or at inappropriately high frequencies. Changes in sodium channel gene expression also occur in experimental models of inflammatory pain. These observations indicate that abnormal sodium channel expression can contribute to the molecular pathophysiology of pain. They further suggest that selective blockade of particular subtypes of sodium channels may provide new, pharmacological approaches to treatment of disease involving hyperexcitability of primary sensory neurons. © 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

	abstract = {Background: A new technique, cutaneous field stimulation (CFS), which activates electrically unmyelinated C-fibers, is used to treat localized itch. Its action is similar to that of capsaicin, the pungent agent in hot peppers, which enhances delayed allergic reactions. The aim of the study was to investigate how experimental contact dermatitis responds to CFS. Methods: Twelve patients with contact dermatitis in response to nickel were treated by CFS for 1 h each for four consecutive days. A flexible plate containing electrodes was applied to a test area on the upper arm and was stimulated by a constant current (0.8 mA). On the fifth day, patients were provoked by epicutaneous application of nickel sulfate (allergic contact dermatitis) and benzalkonium chloride (irritant contact dermatitis), and by intradermal tuberculin (delayed immunologic reaction). Twelve other patients with IgE-mediated allergy were treated by CFS on the lower arm for 1 h and were then pricked with histamine and allergen extracts (wheal volume was measured) and were tested using benzoic acid (nonimmunologic contact urticaria; closed test). Ten of these patients were also treated by CFS for four days, and experiments were performed on the fifth day. Results: Test reactions to nickel, benzalkonium, and tuberculin were found to be unaffected by CFS treatment. Although allergic prick test reactions were enhanced (by 28\%) after a single CFS treatment, the associated itch was significantly reduced both after single and repeated CFS treatments (by 65\% and 38\%, respectively). Conclusions: Repeated use of CFS to reduce itch has no adverse effects on contact dermatitis.},

A spiral nerve cuff containing twelve dot electrodes was implanted around the sciatic nerve, and evoked muscle twitch forces were recorded in six experiments. Spatially isolated dot electrodes in four geometries (monopolar, longitudinal tripolar, tripolar with four common anodes, and two parallel tripoles) were combined with transverse field steering current(s) from an anode(s) located 180 degrees around from the cathode(s) to activate different regions of the nerve trunk. A selectivity index was used to construct recruitment curves for a muscle with the optimal degree of selectivity. Physiological responses were correlated with the anatomical structure of the sciatic nerve by identifying the nerve fascicles innervating the four muscles, and by determining the relative positions of the electrodes and the nerve fascicles. The results indicated that the use of transverse field steering current improved selectivity. The relative performance of the various electrode arrangements is discussed.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

A mathematical technique (inverse modeling) was used to compute conduction velocity (CV) histograms from the data. Results were compared to the morphology of age-matched normal sural nerve biopsies. Coefficients of variation (CoVs) revealed the statistical relationship between morphological data (diameter histograms) and electrophysiological data (CV histograms and conventional CAP parameters). No differences were found for the thick fiber group when comparing the CoVs of the diameter histogram parameters with the corresponding CV histogram parameters. Apparently, the same inherent biological interindividual variability is encountered. The CoVs of the CVs of the CAP's main phases are in good agreement with the CoVs of the estimated mean velocity of the thick fiber group. Inverse modeling increases the reliability of the estimation of the number of active fibers as compared to direct CAP amplitude interpretation.© 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

	abstract = {The distribution and function of Shaker-related K+ channels were studied with immunofluorescence and electrophysiology in sciatic nerves of developing rats. At nodes of Ranvier, Na+ channel clustering occurred very early (postnatal days 1–3). Although K+ channels were not yet segregated at most of these sites, they were directly involved in action potential generation, reducing duration, and the refractory period. At ∼1 week, K+ channel clusters were first seen but were within the nodal gap and in paranodes, and only later (weeks 2–4) were they shifted to juxtaparanodal regions. K+ channel function was most dramatic during this transition period, with block producing repetitive firing in response to single stimuli. As K+ channels were increasingly sequestered in juxtaparanodes, conduction became progressively insensitive to K+ channel block. Over the first 3 weeks, K+ channel clustering was often asymmetric, with channels exclusively in the distal paranode in ∼40\% of cases. A computational model suggested a mechanism for the firing patterns observed, and the results provide a role for K+channels in the prevention of aberrant excitation as myelination proceeds during development.},

	abstract = {Although neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) can increase the ability of muscle to exert force, the means by which this is accomplished seem to be different from those associated with voluntary exercise. The aim of the study was to determine whether the recruitment order of motor units elicited by over-the-muscle electrical stimulation is different from that achieved with voluntary activation of muscle. This difference was tested by comparing muscle twitch responses that were elicited by Hoffmann reflexes (H-reflexes) and direct motor responses (M-responses) and by examining the effect of submotor NMES on the twitch force associated with H-reflexes. Because H-reflexes represent the summed activity of many motor units, in a manner that is consistent with volitional activation, variation in the time to peak twitch force indicates changes in the population of motor units that contribute to the response. The results demonstrated that the percutaneous application of submotor NMES to the limbs of human subjects causes a faster-contracting population of motor units to be activated during a test H-reflex. Consequently, it seems that the application of NMES preferentially activates faster-contracting motor units, perhaps those that are normally only active at high exercise intensities under voluntary conditions.},

	abstract = {Objectives: 
        This study was designed to test the stability of recent findings by the authors showing that 40\% of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) descriptors of pain sensation were not classifiable in any MPQ subcategory because of incomprehension, underuse, or ambiguity of usage. The study also was intended to determine the pain intensity ratings for the descriptors and how they relate to the original ratings provided by Melzack and Torgerson.
        Methods: 
        The sample size was twice that of the previous sample; 140 subjects (whose first language was English) assigned MPQ descriptors to individual sensory subcategories and then rated their implied intensity of pain. As in the first study, data were analyzed by a three-step decision rule incorporating the absolute frequency, relative frequency, and distribution of word assignments to the subcategories. Subjects were undergraduate students in a health psychology class at Southern Methodist University.
        Results: 
        Twenty-eight of the 32 words retained in the first study also satisfied criteria for inclusion in the present study, and four additional words that were not included in the first study satisfied the decision rule in the present study. As in the first study, intensity ratings of retained words correlated very highly with those reported by Melzack and Torgerson.
        Conclusion: 
        A parsimonious set of 32 words can be adopted from the MPQ for efficient and unambiguous use in the clinical assessment of pain.},

WhileINa generally activates rapidly when a neuron is depolarized, its inactivation properties differ significantly between different neurons and even within one neuron, whereINa often has slowly and rapidly inactivating components. INainactivation has been suggested to regulate action potential firing frequency in some cells, but no clear picture of this relationship has emerged. We studied INa in both members of the paired mechanosensory neurons of a spider slit-sense organ, where one neuron adapts rapidly (type A) and the other slowly (type B) in response to a step depolarization. In both neuron typesINa activated and inactivated with single time constants of 2–3 ms and 5–10 ms, respectively, varying with the stimulus intensity. However, there was a clear difference in the steady-state inactivation properties of the two neuron types, with the half-maximal inactivation (V50) being −40.1 mV in type A neurons and −58.1 mV in type B neurons. ThereforeINa inactivated closer to the resting potential in the more slowly adapting neurons.INa also recovered from inactivation significantly faster in type B than type A neurons, and the recovery was dependent on conditioning voltage. These results suggest that while the rate of INa inactivation is not responsible for the difference in the adaptation behavior of these two neuron types, the rate of recovery from inactivation may play a major role. Inactivation at lower potentials could therefore be crucial for more rapid recovery.},

We used a modified sucrose-gap chamber to monitor resting and action potentials and observed a hyperpolarizing shift in the nerve potential of rat dorsal and ventral roots by TTX. The block of transient inward Na+ currents was confirmed by the abolition of compound action potentials (CAPs). Moreover, depolarization of nerve roots by elevating extracellular K+ concentrations to 40 mM eliminated CAPs but did not significantly alter TTX-induced hyperpolarizations, indicating that the persistent Na+ currents in nerve roots are not voltage-dependent.

	abstract = {The ionic current underlying the upstroke of axonal action potentials is carried by rapidly activating, voltage-dependent Na+ channels. Termination of the action potential is mediated in part by the rapid inactivation of these Na+ channels. We previously demonstrated that an influx of Na+ plays a critical role in the cascade leading to irreversible anoxic injury in central nervous system white matter. We speculated that a noninactivating Na+ conductance mediates this pathological Na+ influx and persists at depolarized membrane potentials as seen in anoxic axons. In the present study we measured the resting compound membrane potential of rat optic nerves using a modified "grease-gap" technique. Application of tetrodotoxin (2 microM) to resting nerves ([K+]o = 3 mM) or to nerves depolarized by 15 or 40 mM K+ resulted in hyperpolarizing shifts of membrane potential. We interpret these shifts as evidence for a persistent, noninactivating Na+ conductance. This conductance is present at rest and persists in nerves depolarized sufficiently to abolish classical transient Na+ currents. PK/PNa ratios were estimated at 35.5, 23.2, and 88 in 3 mM, 15 mM, and 40 mM K+, respectively. We suggest that this noninactivating Na+ conductance may provide an inward pathway for Na+ ions, necessary for the operation of Na+, K(+)-ATPase. Under pathological conditions, such as anoxia, this conductance is the likely route of Na+ influx, which causes damaging Ca2+ entry through reverse operation of the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger. The presence of this conductance in white matter axons may provide a therapeutic opportunity for diseases such as stroke and spinal cord injury.},

	abstract = {We assessed the sequence of nerve impulses that maximize force output from individual human thenar motor units. When these motor units were stimulated intraneurally by a variable sequence of seven pulses, the pattern of pulses that elicited maximum force always started with a short (5–15 ms) interpulse interval termed a “doublet.” The twitch force summation caused by this “doublet” elicited, on average, 48 ± 13\% (SD) of the maximum tetanic force. The peak amplitude of “doublet” forces was 3.5 times that of the initial twitches, and twitch potentiation appeared to have little influence on twitch force summation elicited by the “doublets.” For some units, the second optimal interpulse interval was also short. Peak forces elicited by the third to sixth interpulse intervals did not change substantially when the last interpulse interval was varied between 5 to 55 ms, so maximum force could not be attributed to any unique interpulse interval. Each successive pulse contributed a smaller force increment. When five to seven pulses were delivered in an optimal sequence, the evoked force was close to that recorded during maximal tetanic stimulation. In contrast, maximal force-time integral was evoked with one short interpulse interval (5–15 ms) then substantially longer interpulse intervals ({\textgreater}100 ms). Maximum force and force-time integrals were therefore elicited by different patterns of stimuli. We conclude that a brief initial interpulse interval (5–15 ms) is required to elicit maximum “doublet” force from human thenar motor units and that near-maximal tetanic forces can be elicited by only five or six additional post-“doublet” pulses if appropriately spaced in time. However, the rate at which these post-“doublet” stimuli must be provided is fairly uncritical. In contrast, maximum post-“doublet” force-time integrals were obtained at intervals corresponding to motoneuronal firing rates of ∼7 Hz, rates close to that typically used to recruit motor units and to maintain weak voluntary contractions.},

Electrical stimuli were applied to the radial nerve during rest and during triceps submaximal and maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs). The mean forces and integrated EMGs generated by SCI subjects during MVCs were significantly less than those produced by controls (P{\textless}0.01), with 74 and 71\% of muscles generating {\textless}10\% control force and EMG, respectively. There was an inverse linear relationship between the evoked and voluntary forces (n=32 muscles of SCI subjects) which, when extrapolated to zero evoked force, also showed significant whole muscle weakness for SCI compared to control subjects (P{\textless}0.01). Severe muscle atrophy was revealed which might reflect disuse and/or muscle denervation subsequent to motoneuron loss. Many triceps muscles of SCI subjects showed no force occlusion (n=41) or were impossible to stimulate selectively (n=61). Force was always evoked when the radial nerve was stimulated during MVCs of SCI subjects. The force elicited by single magnetic shocks applied to the motor cortex at Cz′ during voluntary contractions of SCI subjects was also inversely related to the voluntary triceps force exerted (n=18), but usually no force could be elicited during MVCs. Thus central motor drive was probably maximal to these muscles, and the force evoked during MVCs by below-lesion stimulation must come from activation of paralyzed muscle. SCI subjects also had significantly longer mean central nervous system (CNS) conduction times to triceps (P{\textless}0.01) suggesting that the measured deficits reflect CNS rather than peripheral nervous system factors. Thus, the weak voluntary strength of these partially paralyzed muscles is not due to submaximal excitation of higher CNS centers, but results mainly from reduction of this input to triceps motoneurons.},

Eleven percent of units from the SCI population generated normal electromyograms (EMGs) but exerted no measurable force, 65\% generated force comparable to the control data, while 24\% were stronger than usual. Weak units probably reflect disuse. Muscle shortening, densely innervated territories, and polyphasic EMG potentials suggested strong units resulted from intact axons sprouting to reinnervate denervated muscle. Many units from SCI subjects had faster than normal contraction times (CTs). The force and CT distributions from the SCI and A-B populations differed significantly. Motor units of SCI subjects were recruited in order of increasing force output and increasing contraction time. Chronic cervical SCI therefore seems to alter the expected triceps brachii motor unit force-speed relations. © 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Muscle Nerve, 20, 212–220, 1997.},

Approximately half the paralyzed thenar muscles were significantly weaker than control muscles and their compound action potential amplitudes were reduced significantly. Paralyzed muscles had significantly higher twitch/tetanus force ratios. The mean stimulus frequency which generated half-maximal force was also reduced significantly.

This study was designed to determine whether human thenar motor units can be classified into types by the same physiological criteria used for other mammalian limb motor units and to consider whether such classification is functionally relevant. 2. Contractile responses of 25 human thenar single motor units were examined when their motor axons were stimulated intraneurally at rates from 1 to 100 Hz and intermittently at 40 Hz in a conventional 2-min fatigue test. Twitch and tetanic forces were measured together with various indexes of contractile rate. 3. Twitch contraction times and subtetanic to maximum tetanic force ratios were both distributed continuously. "Sag" in tension was not evident in unfused force profiles. Thus these units could not be divided into fast and slow types by the use of traditional contractile rate criteria. 4. Most units were fatigue resistant, with force fatigue indexes (FI) ranging from 0.33 to 1.14. None could be classified as fatiguable (FI less than 0.25). Seven units (28\%) fell into the fatigue-intermediate (FI = 0.25-0.75) category, whereas 18 units (72\%) had FI greater than 0.75, i.e., they were fatigue-resistant units. However, these units could not be classified by conventional FI and contractile rate criteria, because fatigue-resistant and fatigue-intermediate units had similar contractile rates. 5. Additional FI were calculated to describe changes in contractile rate. During the fatigue test, units behaved in one of three ways, showing 1) little change in either force or rate; 2) contractile slowing during the contraction and relaxation phases, with little or no force loss; or 3) both force and rate reduction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {1. Measurements of twitch contractile properties of human motor units recorded by spike-triggered averaging may be distorted by partial fusion between twitches, because motor units seldom fire at rates below 8-10 Hz. The effects of this fusion were examined by comparing the responses of 27 human thenar motor units when their motor axons were stimulated at 1, 8, and 10 Hz. 2. Resultant forces were calculated from the abduction and flexion force components, together with various contraction and relaxation rate indexes as reported previously. Values for single twitches were compared to measurements made from the unfused force fluctuations ("apparent twitches") of the same units recorded during 8 and 10 Hz stimulation. 3. For all units, stimulation at 8 and 10 Hz caused partial twitch fusion. At 10 Hz, mean values for "apparent twitch" forces, contraction times (CT), and one-half relaxation times (1/2RT) were reduced to 44, 76, and 52\% of the corresponding values measured from separate twitches evoked by 1 Hz stimulation. Similar but smaller reductions were seen at 8 Hz. 4. Slow units, with initial twitch CT greater than 60 ms, showed significantly more distortion of all "apparent twitch" parameters when stimulated at both 8 and 10 Hz, compared to fast units (less than 50 ms). 5. The potentiated abduction force component data were compared with abduction forces obtained previously by spike-triggered averaging from the same muscle group. Mean force obtained by spike-triggered averaging ("STA twitch" force: 21 mN) was significantly larger than that measured in abduction in response to either 1 or 10 Hz motor-axon stimulation (14 mN, 6 mN, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Various indexes of contraction and relaxation rate were measured including contraction time (time from force onset to peak), one-half relaxation time (time from peak force to one-half that value), normalized maximum contraction and normalized maximum relaxation rates (peak positive and negative time derivatives of the force signal normalized to twitch force), and the times at which these maximum rates occurred. 3. For different units, the directions of resultant forces were approximately evenly distributed between thumb abduction and flexion. At the onset of the experiment, initial twitch forces ranged from 3 to 34 mN, contraction times from 35 to 80 ms, and one-half relaxation times from 25 to 108 ms. 4. Resultant twitch forces were positively correlated to normalized maximum relaxation rates, but not to other rate indexes or to conduction velocity. The various contraction rate measures were correlated to each other, but generally not to relaxation rates. 5. After the first test involving tetanic stimulation, the twitches of most units were potentiated and slowed, especially their relaxation phase. However, the extent of these changes varied considerably between units. In general, units with weak initial forces potentiated most, some up to three-fold. These changes in twitch properties were denoted posttetanic twitch potentiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {1. The depression in axonal excitability that follows short trains of impulses (H1) may lead to spike frequency adaptation to a sustained stimulus, and has been attributed to a slow K+ conductance. The present experiments sought indirect evidence for slow K+ channels at the node of Ranvier of human cutaneous afferents based on the demonstration of post-tetanic changes in excitability typical of H1. 2. The excitability changes in low-threshold cutaneous afferents in the digital nerves of the index finger were explored using a submaximal test pulse conditioned by trains of supramaximal stimuli, containing up to 100 impulses. Changes in the amplitude of the compound sensory action potential set up by a constant test stimulus were used as a measure of the changes in excitability. These changes in amplitude were paralleled by inverse changes in latency. 3. When the conditioning stimulus was a single supramaximal pulse, excitability was enhanced at conditioning-test intervals of 4-40 ms, with a peak at 6-8 ms. When the conditioning stimulus consisted of a train of ten pulses delivered at 200 Hz, the recovery cycle was dominated by subnormality that was maximal at 20 ms and subsided gradually over 50 ms. 4. The post-train depression in excitability increased as the number of pulses in the conditioning train increased to ten but changed little with further increases in train duration. The degree of depression increased with the pulse frequency within the train. Cooling the hand from a skin temperature of 35 to 25 degrees C slowed the recovery processes but did not alter the magnitude of the post-train depression. 5. These characteristics are typical of the H1 phase of post-tetanic depression in axonal excitability. The extent of the depression in excitability suggests, first, that there may be a significant K+ conductance at the nodes of human cutaneous afferents and, secondly, that H1 may play a significant role in limiting repetitive discharge in normal and pathological afferents.},

These errors can have a significant impact on predicted nerve fiber recruitment patterns when evaluating the efficacy of specific surface or intramuscular stimulus electrode configurations. The results of this study also suggest when a more comprehensive tissue model should be implemented in an electrode design study. Simulation results indicate that the isotropy assumption is worst under bipolar electrode stimulation as opposed to monopolar stimulation and that the bipolar error increases as the distance between electrodes decreases. In light of these results, it is concluded that in order to avoid large errors in the calculated potential distribution along an axon, the isotropy assumption should only be used when the transverse depth from the electrode to the nerve is relatively small.},

	abstract = {The reasons for the resistance to ischaemia of peripheral nerves in diabetics are not well understood. We have now explored whether axonal depolarization underlies this phenomenon, as has previously been proposed. Resistance to ischaemia was determined by the new method of “threshold tracking”. This method revealed an increase in excitability of the peroneal nerve at the popliteal fossa during ischaemia, and a decrease in excitability in the post-ischaemic period. The extent of these alterations in 28 type 1 diabetics without peripheral neuropathy showed a strong correlation with the mean blood glucose concentrations during the last 24 h before examination. To test whether the ischaemic resistance was related to membrane potential, we also measured axonal superexcitability in 11 selected diabetics, since it has been shown that post-spike changes in excitability depend on membrane potential. Changes in excitability of the peroneal nerve were measured in the period between 10 and 30 msec following a conditioning supramaximal compound action potential. Under resting conditions, no differences in the post-spike superexcitability were found between controls and diabetics, despite striking differences in their responses to a 10-min pressure cuff. These observations indicate that membrane depolarization is not involved in the resistance to ischaemia of motor axons in diabetic subjects.},

The method is based on measuring the similarity between all the topographic maps in the evoked potential and grouping them into functional micro-states based on minimizing an error function. The similarity is measured as the normalized cross-correlation coefficient. The method was validated on simulated data and tested on its ability to segment a visual evoked potential. On simulated data the method missed from 1\% to 8.5\% of the micro-state boundaries for evoked potentials with a signal-to-noise ratio of 20–1dB, respectively. The proposed segmentation method was compared with segmentation based on K-mean clustering. It was found that the proposed method was better at detecting the correct number of micro-states and was computationally more efficient. The automatic segmentation of the visual evoked potential was compared to the manual segmentation performed by eleven EEG specialists. No significant difference in the deviation of micro-state boundaries was observed between two random EEG specialists and between a random EEG specialist and the automatic method. Thus it was found that the method could reliably segment evoked potentials into their functional micro-states.},

	abstract = {Objective: Widespread deep tissue pain hyperalgesia was evaluated in women with chronic whiplash associated disorder (n = 25) and controls (n = 10) using computerized cuff pressure algometry and hypertonic saline infusion.
Methods: A pneumatic double-chamber cuff was placed around: (i) the arm and (ii) the leg. Cuff inflation rate was constant and the pain intensity was registered continuously on a visual analogue scale (VAS); thresholds of detection and tolerance were extracted. For assessment of spatial summation the protocol was repeated with a single-chamber cuff inflated around the leg. Temporal summation of pain was assessed from the leg with constant cuff pressure stimulation at 2 different pressure intensities for 10 min. Hypertonic saline was infused in the tibialis anterior muscle.
Results: Cuff pressure pain thresholds were lower in subjects with whiplash associated disorder compared with controls (p {\textless} 0.05). Tonic pressure stimulation evoked higher maximal VAS and larger areas under the VAS curve in subjects with whiplash associated disorder compared with controls (p {\textless} 0.05). The pain threshold and tolerance were higher during single cuff than double cuff stimulation. The area under the VAS curve after intramuscular saline infusion was larger in whiplash associated disorder (p {\textless} 0.05).
Conclusion: The results indicated widespread hyperalgesia in chronic whiplash associated disorder and facilitated temporal summation outside the primary pain area, suggesting involvement of central sensitization.},

In pain-free subjects, hypoalgesia following an acute bout of exercise compared with a control condition has consistently been demonstrated also known as exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH). Walking exercise, a low intensity aerobic exercise, is frequently used in clinical practice as an easily applicable intervention for patients with chronic pain. Walking exercise is furthermore recommended as an effective treatment for patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions to alleviate pain and reduce disability, however, the effect of walking on pain sensitivity is currently unknown. The aims of the present study were to investigate (1) the acute effect of walking on pain sensitivity, and (2) the relative (between-subjects) and absolute (within-subject) testretest reliability of the hypoalgesic response across two sessions separated by 1 week.},

	abstract = {Background: The use of conditioning pain modulation (CPM) is hampered by poor reproducibility and lack of user-independent paradigms. This study reﬁned the CPM paradigm by applying user-independent cuff algometry.
Methods: In 20 subjects, the CPM effect of conditioning with cuff stimulation on the arm was investigated by pain test stimuli on the contralateral leg before and in parallel with different cuff conditionings (10, 30, 60 kPa/60 s; 30, 60 kPa/10 s). As test stimulus, another cuff was inﬂated (1 kPa/s) until the subjects detected the pain tolerance threshold (PTT) during which the pain detection threshold (PDT) and the pressure at a pain intensity of 6 cm on a 10-cm visual analogue scale (PVAS6) were extracted. For comparison, pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) as test stimuli were recorded by the user-dependent handheld pressure algometry. Combinations of cuff locations for conditioning (pain intensity standardized) and contralateral test stimuli were additionally evaluated (leg–arm, leg–leg, arm–thigh). The test–retest reliability in two sessions 1 month apart was assessed in ﬁve CPM protocols.
Results: In all protocols, the PDT, PVAS6 and PTT increased during conditioning compared with baseline (p {\textless} 0.05). The CPM effect (i.e. conditioning minus baseline) for PVAS6, PTT and PPT increased for increasing conditioning intensities (p {\textless} 0.05). The CPM effects were not signiﬁcantly different for changes in conditioning durations or conditioning/ test stimulus locations. In two sessions, the CPM effects for PVAS6 and PTT assessed after 60 s of conditioning on the leg/thigh showed the highest intra-class correlations (0.47–0.73), where they were 0.04–0.6 for PPTs.
Conclusions: The user-independent cuff algometry is reliable for CPM assessment and for supra-pain threshold test stimuli better than the user-dependent technology.},

This study used data from over 18,000 subjects aged 40 years or older from the general population, who participated in the Tromsø Study 7. They underwent a one-time assessment of cuff algometry pressure pain tolerance (PPT) and cold pain tolerance (CPT), tested with a cold pressor test. The results showed a clear seasonal variation in CPT. The rate of withdrawal in the cold pressor test was up to 75\% higher in months in the warmer parts of the year compared with January 2016. There was no seasonal variation in PPT. The study not only found a nonrandom short-term variation in PPT but also indications of such a variation in CPT. The intrinsic timescale of this short-term variation in PPT was 5.1 days (95\% \% confidence interval 4.0-7.2), which is similar to the observed timescales of meteorological variables. Pressure pain tolerance and CPT correlated with meteorological variables, and these correlations changed over time. Finally, temperature and barometric pressure predicted future values of PPT. These findings suggest that weather has a causal and dynamic effect on pain tolerance, which supports the common belief that weather affects pain.},

	abstract = {Background: The phenomenon of temporal summation to repetitive pressure pain stimuli is an important central neural mechanism for pain intensity encoding. This study evaluated the time-dependent behaviour of mechanical characteristics of soft tissue during repeated cuff stimulation used for eliciting temporal summation of cuff pressureevoked pain. Such information of tissue mechanics is important for the interpretation of the pain response evoked during sequential stimulations.
Methods: Temporal summation was assessed in 16 subjects separated into two groups (healthy controls and severe knee osteoarthritis patients) using a visual analogue scale during 10 repetitive painful cuff stimuli (1-s duration, 1-s break) of the lower leg. The geometry of the lower leg was constructed based on magnetic resonance image (MRI) data. The loading boundary condition of the ﬁnite element model was deﬁned according to the parabolic pattern of the interface pressure around the limb and the time-dependent proﬁle of the cuff pressure during repetitive stimuli.
Results: The pain intensity signiﬁcantly increased with an increasing number of stimuli (p {\textless} 0.001), and facilitated temporal summation of pain was observed in patients compared with healthy controls (p {\textless} 0.001). The maximal deep tissue stress and strain during stimuli 1–4 varied 43\% and 9\%, respectively. No variation was observed for stimuli 5–10.
Conclusions: The study concludes that the temporal summation of pain response during sequential cuff pressure is not explicable by a speciﬁc time-dependent behaviour of stress and strain in the activated deep tissue and hence not due to changes in tissue biomechanics.},

The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between mechanical hyperalgesia assessed by manual TP examination and clinical disease severity. 271 women with CWP were recruited from a clinical setting. Data collection included patient-reported symptoms, health-related quality of life variables, and observation-based measures of functional ability, muscle strength, 6-minute walk, and pressure pain thresholds measured by cuff algometry. TP examination was conducted according to ACR-guidelines. Relationships between disease variables and TP count (TPC) were analyzed with logistic regression in a continuum model, allowing the TPC to depend on the included disease variables and two regression models carried out for a TPC threshold level, varying between 1 and 17. The threshold analyses indicated a TPC threshold at 8, above which a large number of disease variables became consistently significant explanatory factors, whereas none of the disease variables reached a significance level in the continuum model. These results support the premise that the presence of mechanical hyperalgesia influences symptomatology in CWP and that the severity of clinical expression is related to a threshold of TPs, rather than being part of a continuum.},

	abstract = {Objectives. Stress and pain have been interrelated in clinical widespread pain conditions. Studies indicate that acute experimental stress in healthy volunteers has a negative effect on the descending inhibitory pain control system and thus the ability to inhibit one painful stimulus with another (conditioned pain modulation [CPM]) although without effect on general pain sensitivity. CPM effects can be assessed immediately after the stress induction, whereas some physiological stress responses (e.g., cortisol release) are delayed and longer lasting. It is unclear whether CPM may relate to stress-induced increases in cortisol. Design. Twenty-ﬁve healthy men had CPM effects measured over a period of 10 minutes. Pain detection thresholds (PDTs) were assessed by repeated test stimuli with cuff algometry on one leg, with and without painful cuff pressure conditioning on the contralateral leg. CPM effects, assessed as the increase in PDT during conditioning stimulation compared with without, were measured before and after experimental stress and a control condition (Montreal Imaging Stress Task [MIST]). Saliva cortisol levels and selfperceived stress were collected. Results. Participants reported the MIST to be more stressful compared with the MIST control, but cortisol levels did not change signiﬁcantly from baseline. In all sessions, PDT increased during conditioning (P ¼ 0.001), although the MIST compared with the MIST control had no signiﬁcant effect on PDT or CPM effects. A negative correlation between changes in cortisol and conditioned PDT was found when applying the MIST (P {\textless} 0.03). Conclusions. No signiﬁcant effect of stress was found on CPM compared with a matched control condition. Individual changes in experimental stress and in conditioned pain sensitivity may be linked with cortisol.},

	abstract = {Exercise is often used for pain rehabilitation but the link between physical activity level and pain sensitivity is still not fully understood. Pressure pain sensitivity to cuff algometry and conditioned pain modulation (CPM) were evaluated in highly active men (n=22), normally active men (n=26), highly active women (n=27) and normally active women (n=23) based on the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire. Cuff pressure pain sensitivity was assessed at the arm and lower leg. The subjects scored the pain intensity on an electronic Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) during ten minutes with 25 kPa constant cuff pressure and two minutes with zero pressure. The maximal VAS score and area under the VAS-curve were extracted. Pressure pain thresholds (PPT) were recorded by manual pressure algometry on the ipsilateral tibialis anterior muscle before, during and after the tonic arm stimulation. Tonic cuff stimulation of the arm and leg resulted in higher VAS peak scores in women compared with men (p{\textless}0.04). In all groups the PPTs were reduced during and after the cuff stimulation compared with baseline (p=0.001). PPT were higher in men compared with women (p=0.03) and higher in highly physical active compared with normal active (p=0.048). Besides the well-known gender difference in pressure pain sensitivity this study demonstrates that a high physical fitness degree in non-athletic subjects is associated with increased pressure pain thresholds but does not affect cuff pressure pain sensitivity in healthy people.},

	abstract = {Widespread pain and pain hypersensitivity are the hallmark of ﬁbromyalgia, a complex pain condition linked to central sensitization. In this study the painDETECT questionnaire (PDQ), validated to identify neuropathic pain and based on pain quality items, was applied in a cross-sectional sample of patients with chronic widespread pain (CWP). The aims of the study were to assess the patient-reported sensory neuropathic symptoms by PDQ and to correlate these with tender point (TP) count and pressure-pain thresholds. Eighty-one patients (75 F, 6 M) with CWP (ACR-criteria) ﬁlled in the PDQ. Manual TP examination was conducted according to ACR guidelines. Computerized cuff pressure algometry was used for the assessment of pressure-pain detection thresholds (PDT, unit: kPa) and pressure-pain tolerance thresholds (PTT, unit: kPa). Mean TP count was 14.32 (range: 2–18), mean PDQ score 22.75 (range: 5–37). Mean PDT was 8.8 kPa (range: 2–36) and mean PTT 30.9 kPa (range: 4–85). Deep-tissue hyperalgesia was the predominant somatosensory symptom reported in 83\%, but other neuropathic symptoms were also frequent, e.g. burning 51\% and prickling 47\%. Statistically signiﬁcant correlations were found between PDQ score and TP count: r = 0.35 (p {\textless} 0.01), and PDQ score and PDT: r = 0.45 (p {\textless} 0.01), and PTT: r = 0.43 (p {\textless} 0.01). The study indicates that pain in CWP has neuropathic features, and that the presence and number of tender points are associated with neuropathic pain symptoms. A high mean PDQ score was found to correlate with TP count and pressure-pain thresholds. The PDQ may become a useful tool assisting in the identiﬁcation of central sensitization in patients with CWP and in the future diagnostic assessment ﬁbromyalgia.},

This doubleblinded crossover study assessed NGF-evoked pain in healthy humans after repeated NGF injections in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle compared with control injections of isotonic saline. Subjects. Twenty healthy subjects participated in two experimental phases; each consisted of seven sessions over 21 days. Methods. At day 0, day 2, and day 4, a low-dose NGF (1 mg) was injected. Data on daily self-reported muscle pain (using a Likert scale) were collected. Data on pressure pain thresholds (PPTs), pain evoked by nonischemic and ischemic muscle contractions (using a numerical rating scale [NRS]), pressure pain detection (PDT), and pain tolerance thresholds (PTTs) to cuff algometry were recorded before day 0 and at 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, and 21 days after the ﬁrst injection. Temporal summation of pain (TSP) and conditioned pain modulation (CPM) were recorded to assess central pain mechanisms. Results. Likert scores remained elevated for 9 days after NGF injection (P{\textless}0.05). PPTs at the TA muscle were decreased at day 1 until day 7 after NGF injection compared with day 0 (P¼0.05). In subjects presenting with NGF-induced muscle hyperalgesia, pain NRS scores evoked by nonischemic contractions were higher after NGF injection at day 4 and day 7 (P{\textless}0.04) compared with the control condition. At all time points, higher pain NRS scores were found with ischemic compared with nonischemic contractions (P{\textless}0.05). The pain NRS after ischemic contractions was elevated following prolonged NGF hyperalgesia at day 7 compared with the control condition and day 0 (P{\textless}0.04). The PDT, PTT, TSP, and CPM remained unchanged during the period of NGF-induced hyperalgesia. Conclusions. Repeated low-dose NGF injections maintain muscle pain and potentiate pain evoked by ischemic contractions during prolonged NGF hyperalgesia.},

	abstract = {Background: Peripheral and central sensitisation is prominent in knee osteoarthritis (KOA) and could be important for the reduced efﬁcacy in some cases after as well surgery as pharmacological interventions. Although sensitisation is important in KOA it is not known to what degree it contributes to the overall clinical pain problem. The aim was therefore to investigate how much a combination of quantitative pain measures assessing various pain mechanisms (local and spreading hyperalgesia, temporal and spatial summation, descending inhibition) could predict peak pain intensity in patients with KOA.
Methods: While resting in a comfortable recumbent position the pressure pain thresholds (PPT) in the peripatellar region (eight locations) and at the tibialis anterior muscle (TA) were assessed by handheld pressure algometry, computer-controlled pressure algometry and cuff-algometry in the affected leg of 17 KOA patients without pain or sensory dysfunctions in other regions than the knee. Cuff-algometry was used to detect spatial pain summation of the lower leg. Temporal pain summation was assessed by repeated pressure stimulation on the TA muscle. The conditioning pain modulation (CPM) was evaluated by conditioning tonic arm pain and by PPT from the peripatellar region. The participants rated their peak pain intensity in the previous 24 h using on a 10 cm visual analogue scale.
Results: A multiple-regression model based on TA pressure pain sensitivity (spreading sensitisation) and temporal pain summation on the lower leg accounted for 55\% of the variance in peak pain intensity experienced by the patients (P = 0.001). Signiﬁcant correlations (P {\textless} 0.05) were found between PPTs assessed by handheld pressure algometry in the peripatellar region and at TA (R = 0.94), PPTs assessed by computercontrolled pressure algometry and handheld pressure algometry in the peripatellar region (R = 0.71), PPTs assessed by computer-controlled pressure algometry in the peripatellar region and handheld pressure algometry at TA (R = 0.71) and temporal summation at the knee and at TA (R = 0.73).
Conclusion: Based on the multiple regression model 55\% variance of the perceived maximal pain intensity in painful KOA could be explained by the quantitative experimental pain measures reﬂecting central pain mechanisms (spreading sensitisation, temporal summation). The lack of other correlations between the methods used in assessing pain mechanisms in this study highlights the importance of applying different tests and different pain modalities when assessing the sensitised pain system as different methods add complementary information.},

It remains unknown whether alterations are causal, consequential, or coincidental to pain presence. This study investigated pronociceptive and antinociceptive mechanisms in recurrent LBP (RLBP) patients across painful and pain-free periods, compared with age/sex-matched asymptomatic controls. During a painful episode (day 0) and when pain-free (day 28), 30 RLBP patients were assessed and compared with 30 controls over the same timeframe. Pressure pain thresholds were recorded bilaterally on the arm, back, and leg. Cuff algometry was used to assess cuff pressure pain detection threshold and cuff pain tolerance threshold on the lower legs, as well as temporal summation of pain (10 repeated painful cuff test stimuli on the dominant leg scored on a visual analogue scale) and conditioned pain modulation ([CPM]: cuff pain detection/tolerance threshold on dominant leg, before vs during painful cuff conditioning on the contralateral leg). Recurrent LBP patients displayed reduced pressure pain thresholds at the arm and back on day 0 compared with day 28 (P , 0.047) and with controls on day 0 (P , 0.049). Cuff pain detection threshold was reduced, and ratings of suprathreshold test stimuli were increased in RLBP patients on day 0 compared with day 28 (P , 0.02). Temporal summation of pain magnitude (increase in visual analogue scale scores) was enhanced in RLBP participants on day 0 compared with day 28 (P 5 0.027) and with controls on day 0 (P 5 0.039). Conditioned pain modulation magnitude (increased threshold during conditioning) was lower overall in RLBP participants than in controls (P 5 0.021). Enhanced pronociceptive mechanisms were observed in RLBP patients. When pain-free, measures returned to similar levels as controls, except for CPM, which remained impaired.},

	abstract = {Musculoskeletal pain affects approximately 20\% of the population worldwide and represents one of the leading causes of global disability. As yet, precise mechanisms underlying the development of musculoskeletal pain and transition to chronicity remain unclear, though individual factors such as sleep quality, physical activity, affective state, pain catastrophizing and psychophysical pain sensitivity have all been suggested to be involved. This study aimed to investigate whether factors at baseline could predict musculoskeletal pain intensity to an experimental delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS) pain model. Demographics, physical activity, pain catastrophizing, affective state, sleep quality, isometric force production, temporal summation of pain, and psychophysical pain sensitivity using handheld and cuff algometry were assessed at baseline (Day-0) and two days after (Day-2) in 28 healthy participants. DOMS was induced on Day-0 by completing eccentric calf raises on the non-dominant leg to fatigue. On Day-2, participants rated pain on muscle contraction (visual analogue scale, VAS, 0-10cm) and function (Likert scale, 0–6). DOMS resulted in non-dominant calf pain at Day-2 (3.0±2.3cm), with significantly reduced isometric force production (P{\textless}0.043) and handheld pressure pain thresholds (P{\textless}0.010) at Day-2 compared to Day-0. Linear regression models using backward selection predicted from 39.3\% (P{\textless}0.003) of VAS to 57.7\% (P{\textless}0.001) of Likert score variation in DOMS pain intensity and consistently included cuff pressure pain tolerance threshold (P{\textless}0.01), temporal summation of pain (P{\textless}0.04), and age (P{\textless}0.02) as independent predictive factors. The findings indicate that age, psychological and central pain mechanistic factors are consistently associated with pain following acute muscle injury.},

The second experiment assessed cuff algometry before and during skin and muscle sensitization with capsaicin cream and injection of capsaicin. Pressure-pain detection threshold, pressure equivalent to the pain intensity of 2 on the VAS (PVAS2), pressure-pain tolerance threshold, and pressure-pain stimulus-response (SR) function were evaluated. Local anesthesia of the muscle increased the pain thresholds significantly and shifted the average SR function to the right indicating desensitization, whereas cutaneous anesthesia did not affect the pressure thresholds and increased the slope of the SR function. Capsaicin cream did not affect pressure-pain tolerance threshold, whereas PVAS2 and the slope of the SR function were significantly decreased. Intramuscular capsaicin injection decreased the pain thresholds and did not affect the slope of the SR function. Both interventions shifted the SR function to the left. The cuff algometry reliably assessed the pressurepain SR function during muscle sensitization/desensitization and might supplement conventional pressure algometry for standardized pressure-pain function assessment.},

	abstract = {Chronic postoperative pain after total knee replacement (TKR) in knee osteoarthritis (KOA) implies clinical challenges. Widespread hyperalgesia, facilitated temporal summation of pain (TSP), and impaired conditioned pain modulation (CPM) have been found in painful KOA. This exploratory study investigated postoperative pain relief 12 months after TKR in 4 subgroups of patients preoperatively profiled by mechanistic quantitative sensory testing. In 103 patients with KOA, pressure pain detection threshold (PDT) and tolerance thresholds (PTT) were assessed at the lower leg using cuff algometry. Temporal summation of pain was measured as an increase in pain intensity scores during 10 repeated (2 seconds intervals) painful cuff stimuli. Conditioned pain modulation was calculated as the relative increase in PDT during painful conditioning stimulation. The grand averages of TSP and CPM were calculated and values below or above were used for subgrouping: facilitated TSP/impaired CPM (group A, N 5 16), facilitated TSP/normal CPM (group B, N 5 15), normal TSP/impaired CPM (group C, N 5 44), and normal TSP/normal CPM (group D, N 5 28). Clinical VAS pain intensity scores were collected before and 12 months after TKR surgery and the pain relief calculated. Less pain relief was found in group A (52.0\% 6 14.0\% pain relief) than in group B (81.1\% 6 3.5\%, P 5 0.023) and group C (79.6\% 6 4.4\%, P 5 0.007), but not group D (69.4\% 6 7.9\%, P 5 0.087). Low preoperative PDT was associated with a less postoperative pain relief (R 5 20.222, P 5 0.034), whereas TSP or CPM alone showed no associations with postoperative pain relief. This explorative study indicated that patients with osteoarthritis with facilitated TSP together with impaired CPM are more vulnerable to experience less pain relief after TKR.},

	abstract = {Objectives
              . In some rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, joint pain persists without signs of inflammation. This indicates that central pain sensitisation may play a role in the generation of chronic pain in a subgroup of RA. Our aim was to assess the degree of peripheral and central pain sensitisation in women with active RA compared to healthy controls (HC).
              Methods
              . 38 women with active RA (
              
                DAS28
                {\textgreater}
                2.6
              
              ) and 38 female HC were included in, and completed, the study. Exclusion criteria were polyneuropathy, pregnancy, and no Danish language. Cuff Pressure Algometry measurements were carried out on the dominant lower leg. Pain threshold, pain tolerance, and pain sensitivity during tonic painful stimulation were recorded.
              Results
              . Women with active RA had significantly lower pain threshold (
              
                p
                {\textless}
                0.01
              
              ) and pain tolerance (
              
                p
                {\textless}
                0.01
              
              ) than HC. The mean temporal summation- (TS-) index in RA patients was 0.98 (SEM: 0.09) and 0.71 (SEM: 0.04) in HC (
              
                p

                0.01
              
              ).
              Conclusion
              . Patients with active RA showed decreased pressure-pain threshold compared to HC. In addition, temporal summation of pressure-pain was increased, indicating central pain sensitization, at least in some patients. Defining this subgroup of patients may be of importance when considering treatment strategies.},

	abstract = {Pain biomarkers are warranted for individualized pain management. Based on different pain modulatory phenotypes, the objectives of this study were to explore the existence of subgroups within patients with nonmalignant chronic pain and to investigate differences in clinical pain and pain hypersensitivity between subgroups. Cuff algometry was performed on lower legs in 400 patients with chronic pain to assess pressure pain threshold, pressure pain tolerance, temporal summation of pain (TSP: increase in pain scores to 10 repeated stimulations), and conditioned pain modulation (CPM: increase in cuff pressure pain threshold during cuff pain conditioning on the contralateral leg). Heat detection and heat pain thresholds at clinical painful and nonpainful body areas were assessed. Based on TSP and CPM, 4 distinct groups were formed: group 1 (n 5 85) had impaired CPM and facilitated TSP; group 2 (n 5 148) had impaired CPM and normal TSP; group 3 (n 5 45) had normal CPM and facilitated TSP; and group 4 (n 5 122) had normal CPM and normal TSP. Group 1 showed more pain regions than the other 3 groups (P , 0.001), indicating that impaired CPM and facilitated TSP play an important role in widespread pain. Groups 1 and 2 compared with group 4 had lower heat pain threshold at nonpainful areas and lower cuff pressure pain tolerance (P , 0.02), indicating that CPM plays a role for widespread hyperalgesia. Moreover, group 1 demonstrated higher clinical pain scores than group 4 (P , 0.05). Although not different between subgroups, patients were profiled on demographics, disability, pain catastrophizing, and fear of movement. Future research should investigate interventions tailored towards these subgroups.},

	abstract = {Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is highly disabling, but often without identiﬁable source. Focus has been on impaired anti-nociceptive mechanisms contributing to pain maintenance, though methods of targeting this impairment remain limited. This randomised-controlled cross-over pilot trial used active versus sham medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) high-deﬁnition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) for 3-consecutive days to improve descending pain inhibitory function. Twelve CLBP patients were included with an average visual analogue scale (VAS) pain intensity of 3.0 § 1.5 and pain duration of 5.3 § 2.6 years. Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs), conditioned pain modulation (CPM), and temporal summation of pain (TSP) assessed by cuff algometry, as well as pain symptomatology (intensity, unpleasantness, quality, disability) and related psychological features (pain catastrophizing, anxiety, affect), were assessed on Day1 before 3 consecutive days of HD-tDCS sessions (each 20 minutes), at 24-hours (Day 4) and 2-weeks (Day 21) following ﬁnal HD-tDCS. Blinding was successful. No signiﬁcant differences in psychophysical (PPT, CPM, TSP), symptomatology or psychological outcomes were observed between active and sham HD-tDCS on Day4 and Day21. CPMeffects at Day 1 negatively correlated with change in CPM-effect at Day4 following active HD-tDCS (P = .002). Lack of efﬁcacy was attributed to several factors, not least that patients did not display impaired CPM at baseline.},

	abstract = {Background: Musculoskeletal pain from the upper extremity and shoulder region is commonly reported by computer users. However, the functional status of central pain mechanisms, i.e., central sensitization and conditioned pain modulation (CPM), has not been investigated in this population. The aim was to evaluate sensitization and CPM in computer users with and without chronic musculoskeletal pain.
Methods: Pressure pain threshold (PPT) mapping in the neck-shoulder (15 points) and the elbow (12 points) was assessed together with PPT measurement at mid-point in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle among 47 computer users with chronic pain in the upper extremity and/or neck-shoulder pain (pain group) and 17 pain-free computer users (control group). Induced pain intensities and profiles over time were recorded using a 0-10 cm electronic visual analogue scale (VAS) in response to different levels of pressure stimuli on the forearm with a new technique of dynamic pressure algometry. The efficiency of CPM was assessed using cuff-induced pain as conditioning pain stimulus and PPT at TA as test stimulus.
Results: The demographics, job seniority and number of working hours/week using a computer were similar between groups. The PPTs measured at all 15 points in the neck-shoulder region were not significantly different between groups. There were no significant differences between groups neither in PPTs nor pain intensity induced by dynamic pressure algometry. No significant difference in PPT was observed in TA between groups. During CPM, a significant increase in PPT at TA was observed in both groups (P {\textless} 0.05) without significant differences between groups. For the chronic pain group, higher clinical pain intensity, lower PPT values from the neck-shoulder and higher pain intensity evoked by the roller were all correlated with less efficient descending pain modulation (P {\textless} 0.05).
Conclusions: This suggests that the excitability of the central pain system is normal in a large group of computer users with low pain intensity chronic upper extremity and/or neck-shoulder pain and that increased excitability of the pain system cannot explain the reported pain. However, computer users with higher pain intensity and lower PPTs were found to have decreased efficiency in descending pain modulation.},

	abstract = {Background: Aerobic and isometric exercises are known to decrease pain sensitivity. The effect of different types of exercise on central mechanisms such as temporal summation of pain (TSP) is less clear. This study hypothesized that both aerobic and isometric exercises would increase pressure pain tolerance (PTT) and reduce TSP with greater effects after higher-intensity exercises.
Methods: One hundred thirty-six healthy subjects (18–65 years; 68 women) participated in two randomized crossover experiments with trials on two different days. PTT and TSP were assessed before and after bicycling and a non-exercise condition (experiment 1), and after low- and high-intensity bicycling and low- and high-intensity isometric arm and leg exercises with the dominant arm/leg (experiment 2). PTT and TSP were assessed before and after each exercise condition on the non-dominant arm and leg by computer-controlled cuff algometry. TSP was assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) scores of the pain intensity during sequential cuff-pressure stimulation at the pain tolerance intensity related to that speciﬁc time point.
Results: In experiment 1, bicycling, but not the non-exercise condition, slightly increased PTT when assessed at the leg (p {\textless} 0.05). In experiment 2, isometric arm and leg exercises increased PTT and reduced VAS scores to sequential stimulation at the arm and leg (p {\textless} 0.05). No systematic difference was found between low- and high-intensity exercises.
Conclusions: Different manifestations of hypoalgesia between aerobic and isometric exercises were found. Isometric exercises reduced temporal summation illustrating the potential for exercise as a rehabilitation procedure also targeting the central mechanisms.},

The inflation pressure was controlled and recorded by a computer-control program, while the interface pressure distribution was measured by a flexible pressure sensor mat located between the cuff and skin.
Results. The mean interface pressure across the entire stimulation surface was not significantly different from inflating pressure during air–cuff algometry. For the water cuff there was a significant reduction in the mean interface pressure compared with the inflating pressure at both the detection and tolerance pain levels (P {\textless} 0.002). The interface pressure distribution of the water cuff around the limb was significantly more homogeneous compared with the air cuff (P {\textless} 0.03). This homogeneity showed a significant correlation with pain sensitivity (P {\textless} 0.008).
Conclusion. Cuff systems with a liquid medium optimize the homogeneity of the interface pressure distribution. However, the deviation of the interface pressure from the inflating pressure is crucial as it counteracts the effects of pressure homogeneity on pain sensitivity in water-cuff algometry.},

This study aimed to investigate antinociceptive and pronociceptive pain mechanisms, pain intensity, and psychological distress (depression, anxiety, pain catastrophizing, and fear of movement) in patients with accident-related chronic spinal pain with (N = 44) and without (N = 64) comorbid PTSD characteristics. Materials and Methods: Cuff algometry was performed on lower legs to assess pressure pain threshold (cPPT), tolerance (cPTT), temporal summation of pain (increase in pain scores to 10 repeated stimulations), and conditioning pain modulation (increase in cPPT during cuff pain conditioning on the contralateral leg). Warmth detection threshold and heat pain threshold at the hand were also assessed. Clinical pain intensity (numerical rating scale), psychological distress, and PTSD symptomatology (ICD-11) were assessed with questionnaires. Mediation analyses were performed to investigate possible psychological mediators in the associations between PTSD and pain (intensity and mechanisms). Results: Patients with PTSD demonstrated increased pain intensity, and psychological distress as well as reduced warmth detection threshold and cPTT compared with patients without PTSD (P {\textless} 0.05). No signiﬁcant differences in cPPT, heat pain threshold, temporal summation of pain, and conditioning pain modulation were found. The association between PTSD and pain intensity was mediated by pain catastrophizing, and fear of movement mediated the association with cPTT. Discussion: The association between PTSD and pain intensity is in accordance with the mutual-maintenance and fear-avoidance models. Future studies should investigate changes in pain intensity and mechanisms after treatment targeting comorbid PTSD in chronic pain patients.},

Temporal summation of pain was assessed by recording the pain intensity on a visual analog scale during repeated cuff pressure stimulations at pain tolerance intensity on the lower leg.

Handheld pressure algometry was used to assess pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) on the knee, shin, and forearm. The examiner was blinded to the type of subject assessed.
Results. Compared with pain-free controls, young females with PFP showed no decrease in cuff pain thresholds (P {\textless} 0.40) or facilitated temporal summation (P {\textless} 0.15) but had a lower CPM response (P {\textless} 0.04) and lower PPTs (P {\textless} 0.005).
Conclusions. Young female adults with long-standing PFP demonstrated impaired CPM. This is important because PFP, a peripheral pathology, might have important central components that need to be studied in order to understand its extent and therapeutic implications.},

No studies have compared CPM and EIH in chronic musculoskeletal pain patients with high pain sensitivity (HPS) and low pain sensitivity (LPS). Materials and Methods: On 2 days, manual pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were recorded at the legs, arm, and shoulder in 61 chronic pain patients and they performed the cold pressor test, 2 exercise conditions (bicycling and isometric contraction), and a control condition in a randomized and counterbalanced order. PPTs, pain tolerance, pain tolerance limit, and temporal summation of pain were assessed with cuﬀ algometry before and after the tests. On the basis of a median split of the average PPTs for women and men, respectively, low (LPS; N = 30) and high (HPS; N = 31) pain-sensitivity groups were created. Results: At baseline, cuﬀ PPT and pain tolerance were decreased and temporal summation of pain was increased in the HPS group (P {\textless} 0.02). Cuﬀ PPT increased and pain tolerance limit decreased after the cold pressor test and exercises in LPS (P {\textless} 0.001). Temporal summation of pain was increased after bicycling in HPS (P {\textless} 0.005). Pain tolerance increased after the cold pressor test and exercise in both groups (P {\textless} 0.001). Discussion: CPM and EIH were partly impaired in chronic pain patients with high versus less pain sensitivity, suggesting that the CPM and EIH responses depend on the degree of pain sensitivity. This has clinical implications as clinicians should evaluate pain sensitivity when considering treatment options utilizing the descending modulatory pain control.},

Forty hip OA patients with unilateral pain were assessed before and 6 weeks post-THA and compared with 40 asymptomatic control subjects. Hip pain intensity at rest and while walking was assessed on a visual analogue scale (VAS). Bilateral cuff algometry from the thighs was used to assess the cuff pressure pain thresholds, pressure values at VAS scores equal with 6 cm (PVAS6), cuff pressure tolerance, and temporal summation of pain (TSP) quantified by an increase in VAS scores to repeated phasic cuff stimulations. Correlations between hip pain VAS post-THA and preoperative quantitative sensory testing results were analyzed. Post-THA hip pain VAS scores decreased (P , 0.05) compared with pre-THA. The cuff pressure pain threshold, PVAS6, and cuff pressure tolerance were significantly lower bilaterally in both patients with pre-THA and post-THA compared with controls (P , 0.05). Temporal summation of pain was facilitated bilaterally in patients with pre-THA compared with controls and normalized after THA in postoperative pain-free patients (P , 0.05). Postoperative hip pain VAS scores correlated with preoperative ipsilateral TSP (r 5 0.44, P , 0.05). Bilateral pressure pain hypersensitivity and facilitated TSP were demonstrated in patients with preoperative hip OA.

This study compared the acute effect of hip versus knee exercises on anti‐nociceptive and pro‐nociceptive mechanisms in young females with long‐standing PFP.
Methods: In this randomized cross‐over study, 29 females with PFP performed hip and knee exercises in randomized order during a single day. Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were assessed by handheld pressure algometry at the patella, the tibialis anterior muscle, and the contralateral elbow. Cuff pressure algometry at the lower legs was used to assess pain detection threshold (cPDT) and tolerance (cPTT) as well as conditioned pain modulation (CPM: change in cPDT during contralateral cuff pain conditioning) and temporal summation of pain (TSP: ten painful cuff stimulations assessed on a visual analogue scale [VAS]).
Results: PPTs at the tibialis anterior muscle but not at the patella increased compared with baseline following both exercises (p {\textless} .002). Compared with baseline, the cPDTs and cPTTs increased after both types of exercises (p {\textless} .001). The cPTTs increased more after knee compared to hip exercises (p {\textless} .007). VAS scores for TSP were increased following hip exercises (p {\textless} .001) although the rate of VAS increase over repeated stimulations was not significantly affected by exercises. The CPMeffect was reduced after both types of exercises (p {\textless} .001).
Conclusion: A general hypoalgesic response to slowly increasing pressure stimuli was observed following both hip and knee exercises as well as decreased conditioned pain modulation, potentially indicating an attenuated ability from exercise to inhibit pain.},

	abstract = {Background: Exercise causes an acute decrease in the pain sensitivity known as exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH), but the speciﬁcity to certain pain modalities remains unknown. This study aimed to compare the effect of isometric exercise on the heat and pressure pain sensitivity.
Methods: On three different days, 20 healthy young men performed two submaximal isometric knee extensions (30\% maximal voluntary contraction in 3 min) and a control condition (quiet rest). Before and immediately after exercise and rest, the sensitivity to heat pain and pressure pain was assessed in randomized and counterbalanced order. Cuff pressure pain threshold (cPPT) and pain tolerance (cPTT) were assessed on the ipsilateral lower leg by computer-controlled cuff algometry. Heat pain threshold (HPT) was recorded on the ipsilateral foot by a computer-controlled thermal stimulator.
Results: Cuff pressure pain tolerance was signiﬁcantly increased after exercise compared with baseline and rest (p {\textless} 0.05). Compared with rest, cPPT and HPT were not signiﬁcantly increased by exercise. No signiﬁcant correlation between exercise-induced changes in HPT and cPPT was found. Test–retest reliability before and after the rest condition was better for cPPT and CPTT (intraclass correlation {\textgreater} 0.77) compared with HPT (intraclass correlation = 0.54).
Conclusions: The results indicate that hypoalgesia after submaximal isometric exercise is primarily affecting tolerance of pressure pain compared with the pain threshold. These data contribute to the understanding of how isometric exercise inﬂuences pain perception, which is necessary to optimize the clinical utility of exercise in management of chronic pain.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims: Compounds that act on GABA-receptors produce anti-hyperalgesia in animal models, but little is known on their effects in humans. The aim of this study was to explore the potential usefulness of GABA-agonism for the control of pain in humans. Two agonists at the benzodiazepine-binding site of GABAA-receptors (clobazam and clonazepam) were studied using multiple experimental pain tests. Positive results would support further investigation of GABA agonism for the control of clinical pain.
Methods: In a randomized double-blind crossover design, 16 healthy male volunteers received clobazam 20 mg, clonazepam 1 mg and tolterodine 1 mg (active placebo). The area of static hyperalgesia after intradermal capsaicin injection was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were: area of dynamic hyperalgesia, response to von Frey hair stimulation, pressure pain thresholds, conditioned pain modulation, cutaneous and intramuscular electrical pain thresholds (1, 5 and 20 repeated stimulation), and pain during cuff algometry.
Results: For the primary endpoint, an increase in the area of static hyperalgesia was observed after administration of placebo (p,0.001), but not after clobazam and clonazepam. Results suggestive for an anti-hyperalgesic effect of the benzodiazepines were obtained with all three intramuscular pain models and with cuff algometry. No effect could be detected with the other pain models employed.
Conclusions: Collectively, the results are suggestive for a possible anti-hyperalgesic effect of drugs acting at the GABAAreceptors in humans, particularly in models of secondary hyperalgesia and deep pain. The findings are not conclusive, but support further clinical research on pain modulation by GABAergic drugs. Because of the partial results, future research should focus on compounds acting selectively on subunits of the GABA complex, which may allow the achievement of higher receptor occupancy than unselective drugs. Our data also provide information on the most suitable experimental models for future investigation of GABAergic compounds.},

The CPM-effect is the difference between pain sensitivity assessments (test-stimuli) with and without a painful conditioning stimulus. CPM has been extensively explored but effects of repeated CPM-effects and differences between repeated CPM assessments and comparable control conditions are less studied.
Methods: In 20 healthy men, four 5-min bouts with a test-stimulus in the beginning and midway were applied by cuff-algometry to the dominant leg. The 2nd test-stimulus in each bout was conditioned in parallel by a painful cuff pressure on the contralateral leg. A controlsession was performed without conditioning. The conditioning intensity was 70\% of the pressure-pain tolerance threshold (PTT) assessed at baseline. Pain detection threshold (PDT) was extracted from test-stimuli. CPM/Control-effects were calculated as second minus ﬁrst test-stimulus, and netCPM-effects were calculated as the difference between CPMeffects and Control-effects.
Results: Pain detection threshold increased in all four bouts (p {\textless} 0.02) compared to the unconditioned test-stimulus and compared to the 2nd test-stimulus in bout1, bout3 and bout4 of the control-session (p {\textless} 0.04). In the control-session, the 1st test-stimulus PDT increased from bout1 to bout2, bout3 and bout4 (p {\textless} 0.03). The netCPM-effect increased progressively over the four bouts (p = 0.03).
Conclusion: Conditioned pain modulation-effects were maintained over four consecutive bouts and in the control-session repeated pain thresholds assessments habituated more than in the CPM-session leading to an increase in netCPM-effect over the four bouts.},

	title = {Differences in {Pain} {Processing} {Between} {Patients} with {Chronic} {Low} {Back} {Pain}, {Recurrent} {Low} {Back} {Pain}, and {Fibromyalgia}},
	abstract = {Background: The impairment in musculoskeletal structures in patients with low back pain (LBP) is often disproportionate to their complaint. Therefore, the need arises for exploration of alternative mechanisms contributing to the origin and maintenance of non-specific LBP. The recent focus has been on central nervous system phenomena in LBP and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the various symptoms and characteristics of chronic pain. Knowledge concerning changes in pain processing in LBP remains ambiguous, partly due to the diversity in the LBP population.
Objective: The purpose of this study is to compare quantitative sensory assessment in different groups of LBP patients with regard to chronicity. Recurrent low back pain (RLBP), mild chronic low back pain (CLBP), and severe CLBP are compared on the one hand with healthy controls (HC), and on the other hand with fibromyalgia (FM) patients, in which abnormal pain processing has previously been reported. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Ghent University, Belgium.
Methods: Twenty-three RLBP, 15 mild CLBP, 16 severe CLBP, 26 FM, and 21 HC participated in this study. Quantitative sensory testing was conducted by manual pressure algometry and computercontrolled cuff algometry. A manual algometer was used to evaluate hyperalgesia as well as temporal summation of pain and a cuff algometer was used to evaluate deep tissue hyperalgesia, the efficacy of the conditioned pain modulation and spatial summation of pain.
Results: Pressure pain thresholds by manual algometry were significantly lower in FM compared to HC, RLBP, and severe CLBP. Temporal summation of pain was significantly higher in FM compared to HC and RLBP. Pain tolerance thresholds assessed by cuff algometry were significantly lower in FM compared to HC and RLBP and also in severe CLBP compared to RLBP. No significant differences between groups were found for spatial summation or conditioned pain modulation. Limitations: No psychosocial issues were taken into account for this study.
Conclusion: The present results suggest normal pain sensitivity in RLBP, but future research is needed. In mild and severe CLBP some findings of altered pain processing are evident, although to a lesser extent compared to FM patients. In conclusion, mild and severe CLBP presents within a spectrum, somewhere between completely healthy persons and FM patients, characterized by pain augmentation.},

	abstract = {Background: Efficacy of pain modulation is assessed as the difference in pain sensitivity during a painful conditioning, compared to before (conditioning pain modulation, CPM). Attention can be assessed with the Stroop task, in which participants report the number of words on a screen; either congruent or incongruent with the value of the words. Attention away from painful stimuli during CPM enhances the CPM effect. However, it is unknown if attention influences CPM effects when the two are done in sequence.
Methods: Healthy men (n = 25) underwent cuff algometry CPM‐assessment where the pressure‐pain detection and tolerance thresholds (PTT) were recorded on one leg with and without contralateral conditioning. Two identical sessions of four test stimuli equal to PTT (5 s, 1‐min interval, scored on a visual analogue scale, VAS) with a painful conditioning from the second to the last test‐stimulus were performed. Stroop sessions were followed by test stimuli with or without painful conditioning.
Results: The VAS scores in the first two sessions showed excellent reliability (ICC = 0.92). VAS scores were lower in sessions with Stroop compared to sessions without Stroop (p = .05) indicating an analgesic effect of Stroop. Participants were subgrouped into CPM responders and CPM non‐responders according to CPM effects in the first two sessions. CPM non‐responders (n = 13) showed facilitation to repeated noxious stimuli in all sessions with no effect of conditioning or Stroop (p = .02).
Conclusion: Attention and CPM both modulate pain in healthy men. Attention‐induced analgesia works in CPM non‐responders. Results indicate that attention and CPM are not the same and that they do not demonstrate additive effects when applied in sequence.},

	abstract = {Background: Cuff algometry is used for quantitative pain assessment although it is not clariﬁed which tissues are actually challenged by the stimulation. This study investigated the mechanical stress and strain distribution in superﬁcial and deep tissues during cuff algometry applied on the lower leg at three different intensities (mild pressure, pain threshold and supra pain threshold).
Methods: A computational three-dimensional ﬁnite element model of the lower leg with three different layers of soft tissue was developed based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) recorded during cuff stimulation. Tissue indentation maps were extracted from the MRI scans and transferred into the model as displacement of boundary condition. In all stimulation conditions, the mean stress of subcutaneous adipose and muscle tissue below the cuff decreased compared with the skin while the mean strain peaked in subcutaneous adipose and decreased in other tissues.
Results: At pain threshold stimulation intensity, the mean muscle stress was 2.9\% of mean skin stress and the mean muscle strain was 55.1\% of mean strain in adipose layer. The mean stress and strain increased by 30.4\% and 27.1\%, respectively, in muscle tissue from painful to supra pain threshold stimulation. The stress and strain was mainly focused around the bones and superﬁcially under cuff.
Conclusions: This study shows the better capability of cuff algometry for stimulation of deep somatic tissue in terms of generation of mechanical stress and strain in contrast to the more superﬁcial muscle tissue previously demonstrated to be strained by single-point pressure algometry.},

Forty-eight women with FM and 16 healthy age-matched women were included. A computer-controlled, pneumatic tourniquet cuﬀ was placed over the gastrocnemius muscle. The cuﬀ was inﬂated, and the subject rated the pain intensity continuously on an electronic Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The subject stopped the inﬂation at the pressure-pain tolerance and the corresponding VAS-score was determined (pressure-pain limit). The pressure at which VAS ﬁrstly exceeded 0 was deﬁned as the pressure-pain threshold. Other disease markers (FM only): Isokinetic knee muscle strength, tenderpoint-count, myalgic score, Beck Depression Inventory, and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire. Student’s T-test was used to compare pressure-pain threshold and pressure-pain tolerance and the Mann–Whitney test to compare pressure-pain limit. Pearson’s correlation was used to detect linear relationships. Pressure-pain threshold and pressure-pain tolerance assessed by CPA were signiﬁcantly lower in FM compared to healthy controls. There was no diﬀerence in pressure-pain limit. CPA-parameters were signiﬁcantly correlated to isokinetic muscle strength where more hypersensitivity resulted in lower strength. Pressure-pain threshold and pressure-pain tolerance assessed by CPA were signiﬁcantly lower in patients with FM indicating muscle hyperalgesia. CPA was associated with knee muscle strength but not with measures thought to be inﬂuenced by psychological distress and mood.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to compare the reliability and magnitude of conditioned pain modulation (CPM) by applying different test stimuli (TS) and conditioning stimuli (CS). Twenty-six healthy male participants were recruited in the study of two identical sessions. In each session, four TS (electrical, heat, handheld, and cuff pressure algometry) were applied before and during CS (cold pressor test (CPT) or cuff algometry). The same procedure was repeated with 45-min intervals, but with the other CS. Five thresholds were measured including four pain detection thresholds from four TS and pain tolerance threshold from cuff TS (cuff PTT). Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC (3,1)) and coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated as measures of reliability. The reliability of TS before and during CS was good for all combinations (ICC: 0.60–0.96, CV: 2.2–22.9\%), but the reliability of the CPM effect varied (ICC: 0.04–0.53, CV: 63.6–503.9\%). The most reliable combinations were considered to be the handheld pressure pain threshold with CPT (ICC: 0.49, CV: 63.6\%) and the cuff pressure pain threshold with CPT (ICC: 0.44, CV: 107.6\%). Significant CPM effects were found for all combinations, except the combinations of electrical and heat pain thresholds with cuff CS, which indicates the novel classification of the CPM mechanism. The combinations of handheld pressure and heat pain threshold with CPT would provide the minimum sample size to detect the significant CPM changes in further studies. It is beneficial to provide and compare both ICC and CV to design further clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Methods. Consecutive patients with axial SpA (axSpA) were enrolled in the population-based SPARTAKUS cohort (2015–2017) and classified as AS (n = 120) or nr-axSpA (n = 55). Pain was assessed with questionnaires (intensity/duration/distribution) and computerized cuff pressure algometry to measure pain sensitivity (pain threshold/pain tolerance/temporal summation of pain). Linear regression models were used to compare pain measures between patients with AS and nr-axSpA, and to assess associations between pain sensitivity measures and disease and health outcomes.
Results. Of 175 patients with axSpA, 43\% reported chronic widespread pain, with no significant differences in any questionnaire-derived or algometry-assessed pain measures between patients with AS and nr-axSpA. Lower pain tolerance was associated with longer symptom duration, worse Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score using C-reactive protein (ASDAS-CRP), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index, and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI), more pain regions, unacceptable pain, worse Maastricht AS Enthesitis Score (MASES), fatigue, anxiety, and health-related quality of life. Further, lower pain threshold was associated with worse ASDAS-CRP and MASES, whereas higher temporal summation was associated with longer symptom duration, unacceptable pain, and worse BASMI.
Conclusion. Chronic pain is common in axSpA, with no observed differences in any pain measures between patients with AS and nr-axSpA. Further, higher pain sensitivity is associated with having worse disease and health outcomes. The results indicate that patients with AS and nr-axSpA, in line with most clinical characteristics, have a similar pain burden, and they highlight large unmet needs regarding individualized pain management, regardless of axSpA subgroup.},

In the last decades, it was subject to extensive research due to its high prevalence. Still, a quantitative description of the electrical brain activity during musculoskeletal pain is lacking. This study aimed to characterize intracranial current source density (CSD) estimations during sustained deep-tissue experimental pain. Twenty-three healthy volunteers received three types of tonic stimuli for three minutes each: computer-controlled cuff pressure (1) below pain threshold (sustained deep-tissue no-pain, SDTnP), (2) above pain threshold (sustained deeptissue pain, SDTP) and (3) vibrotactile stimulation (VT). The CSD in response to these stimuli was calculated in seven regions of interest (ROIs) likely involved in pain processing: contralateral anterior cingulate cortex, contralateral primary somatosensory cortex, bilateral anterior insula, contralateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex and contralateral premotor cortex. Results showed that participants exhibited an overall increase in spectral power during SDTP in all seven ROIs compared to both SDTnP and VT, likely reflecting the differences in the salience of these stimuli. Moreover, we observed a difference is CSD due to the type of stimulus, likely reflecting somatosensory discrimination of stimulus intensity. These results describe the different contributions of neural oscillations within these brain regions in the processing of sustained deep-tissue pain.},

	abstract = {Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a common problem globally. Current evidence suggests that maladapted central pain pathways are associated with pain chronicity, for example, in postoperative pain after knee replacement. Other factors such as low mood, anxiety, and tendency to catastrophize are also important contributors. We aimed to investigate brain imaging features that underpin pain chronicity based on multivariate pattern analysis of cerebral blood flow (CBF), as a marker of maladaptive brain changes. This was achieved by identifying CBF patterns that discriminate chronic pain from pain-free conditions and by exploring their explanatory power for factors thought to drive pain chronification. In 44 chronic knee pain and 29 pain-free participants, we acquired both CBF and T1weighted data. Participants completed questionnaires related to affective processes and pressure and cuff algometry to assess pain sensitization. Two factor scores were extracted from these scores representing negative affect and pain sensitization. A spatial covariance principal component analysis of CBF identified 5 components that significantly discriminated chronic pain participants from controls, with the unified network achieving 0.83 discriminatory accuracy (area under the curve). In chronic knee pain, significant patterns of relative hypoperfusion were evident in anterior default-mode and salience network hubs, while hyperperfusion was seen in posterior default mode, thalamus, and sensory regions. One component correlated positively with the pain sensitization score (r 5 0.43, P 5 0.006), suggesting that this CBF pattern reflects neural activity changes encoding pain sensitization. Here, we report a distinct chronic knee pain-related representation of CBF, pointing toward a brain signature underpinning central aspects of pain sensitization.},

Methods: We assessed 1785 13-year old adolescents cross-sectionally. Body image satisfaction was measured using the Children's Figure Rating Scale. Pain detection and tolerance thresholds were assessed using cuff pressure algometry. We quantified the associations between body image categories (satisfied, prefers slightly thinner, prefers much thinner, and prefers heavier) and pain detection and tolerance thresholds using linear and logistic regression for continuous and binary (odds of achieving the highest distribution quarter) outcomes, respectively. Models were adjusted to pubertal stage and body mass index.
Results: Adolescents who desired a heavier silhouette had lower pressure pain tolerance thresholds when compared to those who were satisfied (linear regression coefficient: − 3.95; 95\% confidence interval: − 6.68, − 1.21), which was more precise in boys (− 3.51; − 7.17, − 0.08). Those adolescents also had lower odds of achieving the highest quarter of pressure pain tolerance threshold (odds ratio: 0.66; 0.48, 0.90), especially girls (0.58; 0.35, 0.98). Adolescents who desired much thinner silhouettes had lower odds of achieving the highest quarter of pressure pain tolerance (0.68; 0.46, 1.00), and this was clearer in girls (0.66; 0.48, 0.90). Pain detection thresholds did not show robust associations with body image dissatisfaction.
Conclusion: Our study suggests an association between satisfaction with one's silhouette and pain tolerance in adolescents from the general population, arguing for an integrated approach to the assessment of body image and pain sensitivity.},

	abstract = {Objective. Exercise has beneﬁcial effects on pain in knee osteoarthritis (OA), yet the underlying mechanisms are unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of exercise on pressure–pain sensitivity in patients with knee OA.
Methods. In a randomized controlled trial, participants were assigned to 12 weeks of supervised exercise therapy (ET; 36 sessions) or a no attention control group (CG). Pressure–pain sensitivity was assessed by cuff pressure algometry on the calf of the most symptomatic leg. The coprimary outcomes were pressure–pain thresholds (PPTs) and cumulated visual analog scale pain scores during constant pressure for 6 minutes at 125\% of the PPT as a measure of temporal summation (TS) of pressure–pain. Secondary outcomes included self-reported pain using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire. Analyses were based on the “per-protocol” population (participants following the protocol).
Results. Sixty participants were randomized (31 in ET group, 29 in CG), and the per-protocol population included 48 participants (25 in ET group, 23 in CG). At followup, mean group differences in the change from baseline were 3.1 kPa (95\% conﬁdence interval [95\% CI] 0.2, 6.0; P ؍ 0.038) for the PPT, 2,608 mm ؋ seconds (95\% CI 458, 4,758; P ؍ 0.019) for TS, and 6.8 points (95\% CI 1.2, 12.4; P ؍ 0.018) for KOOS pain, all in favor of ET.
Conclusion. Pressure–pain sensitivity, TS, and self-reported pain are reduced among patients completing a 12-week supervised exercise program compared to a no attention CG. These results demonstrate beneﬁcial effects of exercise on basic pain mechanisms and further exploration may provide a basis for optimized treatment.},

Good-to-excellent intraclass correlations (0.60-0.90) were demonstrated for manual and cuff algometry, and no systematic bias between sessions was found for cPPT, cPTT, and TSP on the leg and for cPTT and TSP on the arm. Cuff pressure pain threshold and cPTT were higher in men compared with women (P , 0.05). Middle-aged subjects had higher pressure pain threshold, but lower cPPT and cPTT, compared with younger subjects (P , 0.05). Temporal summation of pain was increased in women compared with men (P , 0.05). Cuff algometry was sensitive to CPM demonstrated as increased cPPT and cPTT and reduced TSP (P , 0.05). Reliability and sensitivity of computer-controlled cuff algometry for pain assessment is comparable with manual pressure algometry and constitutes a user-independent method for assessment of pain. Difference in agerelated pain sensitivity between manual and cuff algometry should be further investigated.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM) is a well-established phenomenon and several protocols have shown acceptable between-subject reliability [based on intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values] in pain-free controls. Recently, it was recommended that future CPM test-retest reliability studies should explicitly report CPM reliability based on CPM responders and nonresponders (within-subject reliability) based on measurement error of the test stimulus. Identification of reliable CPM paradigms based on responders and non-responders may be a step towards using CPM as a mechanistic marker in diagnosis and individualized pain management regimes. The primary aim of this paper is to investigate the frequency of CPM responders/non-responders, and to quantify the agreements in the classification of responders/non-responders between 2 different days for 10 different CPM protocols.},

In this study, the relative transfer of biomechanical stresses and strains from the cuff via the skin to the muscle and the somatic tissue layers around bones were investigated. Cuff pressure was applied on the lower leg at three different stimulation intensities (mild pressure to pain). Three-dimensional finite element models including bones and three different layers of deep tissues were developed based on magnetic resonance images (MRI). The skin indentation maps at mild pressure, pain threshold, and intense painful stimulations were extracted from MRI and applied to the model. The mean stress under the cuff position around tibia was 4.6, 4.9 and around fibula 14.8, 16.4 times greater than mean stress of muscle surface in the same section at pain threshold and intense painful stimulations, respectively. At the same stimulation intensities, the mean strains around tibia were 36.4, 42.3 \% and around fibula 32.9, 35.0 \%, respectively, of mean strain on the muscle surface. Assuming strain as the ideal stimulus for nociceptors the results suggest that cuff algometry is less capable to challenge the nociceptors of tissues around bones as compared to more superficially located muscles.},

This study investigated the inﬂuence of age on pressure hyperalgesia, TSP, and CPM in patients with KOA and controls. Materials and Methods: One hundred thirty-three severe KOA patients and 50 age-matched and sex-matched asymptomatic controls were assessed by cuﬀ algometry and handheld pressure algometry. Pain sensitivity was assessed around the head of the gastrocnemius muscle to identify mild pain detection threshold (MPDT) and pressure tolerance threshold (PTT). TSP was assessed by visual analogue scale scores of the pain evoked by 10 repetitive cuﬀ stimulations. CPM was assessed as the diﬀerence in PTT before and during cuﬀ-induced tonic arm pain. Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were assessed by handheld algometry at the tibialis anterior muscle. Two subgroups were analyzed in the age range below and above 65 years. Pearson correlations between age and pain parameters were applied. Results: Patients demonstrated reduced MPDT, PTT, and PPT (P {\textless} 0.01), facilitated TSP (P {\textless} 0.02), and a trend toward impaired CPM (P = 0.06) compared with controls. A negative correlation was found between MPDT, PTT, and PPT and age (P {\textless} 0.05) but no age-related association was found for TSP and CPM. Discussion: Pressure hyperalgesia was aﬀected by age whereas dynamic pain mechanisms such as TSP and CPM were unaﬀected suggesting that these parameters are robust for a larger age range and reliable for long-term follow-up studies.},

	abstract = {Objective. Over the recent years, several small area electrodes have been introduced as tools for preferential stimulation of small cutaneous nerve fibers. However, the performance of the electrodes is highly debated and have not previously been systematically compared. The electrodes have been developed empirically and little is known about the electrical potential they produce in the skin, and how this influences the nerve fiber activation. The objective of the present study was to develop and validate a computational model to compare the preferential stimulation of small fibers for electrodes of different designs. Approach. A finite element model of the skin was developed and coupled with an Aβ-fiber and an Aδ-fiber multi-compartmental nerve fiber model, to describe the current spread and consequent nerve fiber activation produced by five different surface electrodes; intra-epidermal, planar concentric, pin, planar array, and patch. The model was validated through experimental assessments of the strength-duration relationship, impedance, and reaction times. Main results. The computational model predicted the intra-epidermal electrode to be the most preferential for small fiber activation. The intra-epidermal electrode was, however, also found to be the most sensitive to positioning relative to nerve fiber location, which may limit the practical use of the electrode. Significance. The present study highlights the influence of different electrode design features on the current spread and resulting activation of cutaneous nerve fibers. Additionally, the computational model may be used for the optimization of electrode design towards even better preferential stimulation of small fibers.},

	abstract = {The excitability of large nerve fibers is reduced when their membrane potential is slowly depolarizing, i.e., the fibers display accommodation. The aim of this study was to assess accommodation in small (mainly Aδ) and large (Aβ) cutaneous sensory nerve fibers using the perception threshold tracking (PTT) technique. Linearly increasing ramp currents (1 ms−200 ms) were used to assess the excitability of the nerve fibers by cutaneous electrical stimulation. To investigate the PPT technique’s ability to preferentially activate different fiber types, topical application of lidocaine/prilocaine (EMLA) or a placebo cream was applied. By means of computational modeling, the underlying mechanisms governing the perception threshold in the two fiber types was studied. The axon models included the voltage-gated ion channels: transient TTX-sensitive sodium current, transient TTX-resistant sodium current (NaTTXr), persistent sodium current, delayed rectifier potassium channel (KDr), slow potassium channel, and hyperpolarization-activated current. Large fibers displayed accommodation, whereas small fibers did not display accommodation (P {\textless} 0.05). For the pin electrode, a significant interaction was observed between cream (EMLA or placebo) and pulse duration (P {\textless} 0.05); for the patch electrode, there was no significant interaction between cream and duration, which supports the pin electrode’s preferential activation of small fibers. The results from the computational model suggested that differences in accommodation between the two fiber types may originate from selective expression of voltage-gated ion channels, particularly the transient NaTTXr and/or KDr. The PTT technique could assess the excitability changes during accommodation in different nerve fibers. Therefore, the PTT technique may be a useful tool for studying excitability in nerve fibers in both healthy and pathological conditions.

NEW \& NOTEWORTHY When large nerve fibers are stimulated by long, slowly increasing electrical pulses, interactive mechanisms counteract the stimulation, which is called accommodation. The perception threshold tracking technique was able to assess accommodation in both small and large fibers. The novelty of this study is that large fibers displayed accommodation, whereas small fibers did not. Additionally, the difference in accommodation between the fiber could be linked to expression of voltage-gated ion channels by means of computational modeling.},

	abstract = {Objective: This assessment evaluates the clinical utility, efficacy, and safety of quantitative sensory testing (QST).
Methods: By searching MEDLINE, Current Contents, and their personal files, the authors identified 350 articles. Selected articles utilized computer operated threshold systems, manually operated threshold systems, and electrical threshold devices. The authors evaluated the use of normal values and the degree of reproducibility between the same and different systems. Articles were rated using a standard classification of evidence scheme.
Results: Because of differences between systems, normal values from one system cannot be transposed to others. Reproducibility of results was also an important concern, and there is no consensus on how it should be defined. The authors identified no adequately powered class I studies demonstrating the effectiveness of QST in evaluating any particular disorder. A number of class II and III studies demonstrated that QST is probably or possibly useful in identifying small or large fiber sensory abnormalities in patients with diabetic neuropathy, small fiber neuropathies, uremic neuropathies, and demyelinating neuropathy.
Conclusions: QST is a potentially useful tool for measuring sensory impairment for clinical and research studies. However, QST results should not be the sole criteria used to diagnose pathology. Because malingering and other nonorganic factors can influence the test results, QST is not currently useful for the purpose of resolving medicolegal matters. Well-designed studies comparing different QST devices and methodologies are needed and should include patients with abnormalities detected solely by QST.},

We determined thermal detection and pain thresholds including a test for paradoxical heat sensations, mechanical detection thresholds to von Frey filaments and a 64Hz tuning fork, mechanical pain thresholds to pinprick stimuli and blunt pressure, stimulus/response-functions for pinprick and dynamic mechanical allodynia, and pain summation (wind-up ratio). QST parameters were region specific and age dependent. Pain thresholds were significantly lower in women than men. Detection thresholds were generally independent of gender. Reference data were normalized to the specific group means and variances (region, age, gender) by calculating z-scores. Due to confidence limits close to the respective limits of the possible data range, heat hypoalgesia, cold hypoalgesia, and mechanical hyperesthesia can hardly be diagnosed. Nevertheless, these parameters can be used for group comparisons. Sensitivity is enhanced by side-to-side comparisons by a factor ranging from 1.1 to 2.5. Relative comparisons across body regions do not offer advantages over absolute reference values. Application of this standardized QST protocol in patients and human surrogate models will allow to infer underlying mechanisms from somatosensory phenotypes.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have used grating orientation as a measure of tactile spatial acuity on the fingerpad. In this task subjects identify the orientation of a grooved surface presented in either the proximal-distal or lateral-medial orientation. Other recent results have suggested that there might be a substantial anisotropy on the fingerpad related to spatial sensitivity. This anisotropy was revealed using a task in which subjects discriminated between a smooth and a grooved surface presented at different orientations on the fingerpad. The anisotropy was substantial enough that it might permit subjects to discriminate grating orientation on the basis of intensive rather than spatial cues. The present study examined the possibility that anisotropy on the fingerpad might provide cues in a spatial acuity task. The ability of subjects to discriminate between a smooth and a grooved surface was measured under conditions that are typically used in grating orientation tasks. No evidence of anisotropy was found. Also, using a grating orientation task, separate estimates were made of sensitivity in the proximal-distal and lateral-medial orientations. Again no evidence of anisotropy was found. Consistent with changes in the density of innervation, grating orientation sensitivity was found to vary as a function of location on the fingerpad. The results support the view that grating orientation is a valid measure of spatial acuity reflecting underlying neural, spatial mechanisms.},

	abstract = {In the social sciences it is common practice to test specific theoretically motivated research hypotheses using formal statistical procedures. Typically, students in these disciplines are trained in such methods starting at an early stage in their academic tenure. On the other hand, in psychophysical research, where parameter estimates are generally obtained using a maximum-likelihood (ML) criterion and data do not lend themselves well to the least-squares methods taught in introductory courses, it is relatively uncommon to see formal model comparisons performed. Rather, it is common practice to estimate the parameters of interest (e.g., detection thresholds) and their standard errors individually across the different experimental conditions and to ‘eyeball’ whether the observed pattern of parameter estimates supports or contradicts some proposed hypothesis. We believe that this is at least in part due to a lack of training in the proper methodology as well as a lack of available software to perform such model comparisons when ML estimators are used. We introduce here a relatively new toolbox of Matlab routines called Palamedes which allows users to perform sophisticated model comparisons. In Palamedes, we implement the model-comparison approach to hypothesis testing. This approach allows researchers considerable flexibility in targeting specific research hypotheses. We discuss in a non-technical manner how this method can be used to perform statistical model comparisons when ML estimators are used. With Palamedes we hope to make sophisticated statistical model comparisons available to researchers who may not have the statistical background or the programming skills to perform such model comparisons from scratch. Note that while Palamedes is specifically geared toward psychophysical data, the core ideas behind the model-comparison approach that our paper discusses generalize to any field in which statistical hypotheses are tested.},

	abstract = {The sensory neural pathways serving the lip, tongue, and finger are specialized for spatial information processing; thus, damage to these pathways is likely to be manifested most prominently as a loss of spatial acuity. For that reason, accurate measurement of spatial resolution at these regions is particularly important. The conventional test, the two-point discrimination task, does not measure the limit of spatial resolution and it yields variable results because it does not control nonspatial cues. The aim of this study was to quantify the limits of spatial resolution at the lip, tongue, and finger and to study the repeatability of those measurements using a stimulus that does not introduce nonspatial cues. We employed a grating orientation discrimination test, which has been studied extensively in relation to the underlying neural mechanisms. We obtained psychophysical thresholds for tactile spatial resolution from 15 normal, young adult subjects over seven test sessions. The finest gratings whose orientations were discriminated reliably had groove widths (gratings had equal groove and bar widths) that averaged 0.51 mm at the lip, 0.58 mm at the tongue, and 0.94 mm at the finger. These threshold measurements were highly reproducible between sessions with an overall improvement of 2\% per session. These data suggest that the grating orientation discrimination task provides a stable, reliable measure of the human capacity for spatial resolution.},

	abstract = {Background: Two-point discrimination, static and dynamic, has long been used as an assessment tool for tactile gnosis, and to assess recovery after repair of a peripheral nerve. While use of a bent paperclip with a specified intertip distance as the assessment device has been described, no research has been performed on the accuracy of setting this distance by hand and eye alone. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate this accuracy. Methods: Five orthopaedic registrars, four residents and three clinic nurses performed static and dynamic two-point discrimination testing on each other. They set the tip distance by hand and eye by bending a paperclip such that the distance between the two ends was their best approximation of 5 mm and then 10 mm. The testing was repeated after 7 days, n = 264 for each tip distance. Results: Two-sample t-tests showed no significant difference (P {\textgreater} 0.53−0.93) between tip distance setting performed by registrars, nurses and residents; while single sample t-test showed a statistically significant difference (P {\textless} 0.0001) between the attempted tip distance and the overall mean tip distance achieved at 5 mm and 10 mm. Conclusion: Statistical analysis showed that the single sample t-test could be discarded. Static and dynamic two-point discrimination testing with a paperclip set by hand and eye is therefore an accurate and reproducible test capable of being administered by both medical and non-medical staff, and is suitable for inclusion in a peripheral nerve repair testing protocol.},

In 96 individuals with LBP this crosssectional study explored (a) the magnitude of exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH) and (b) measures of pain sensitivity and clinical pain manifestations in individuals reporting a clinical relevant increase in back pain during physical activity compared with individuals reporting low or no increase in back pain during physical activity.
Methods: Cuff algometry was performed at baseline on the leg to assess pressure pain threshold (cPPT), tolerance (cPTT) and temporal summation of pain (cTSP). Manual PPTs were assessed on the back and leg before and after a 6-min walk test (6MWT). Back pain was scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS) after each minute of walking. The EIH-effect was estimated as the increase in PPTs after the walk exercise.
Results: Twenty-seven individuals reported an increase of ≥2/10 in pain NRS scores during walking and compared with the individuals with {\textless}2/10 NRS scores: cPPT and EIH-effects were lower whereas cTSP, pain intensity and disability were increased (p {\textless} 0.03). Baseline NRS scores, EIH and pain thresholds were associated with the likelihood of an increase of ≥2/10 in back pain intensity during walking (p {\textless} 0.05).
Conclusions: Pain flares in response to physical activity in individuals with LBP seem to be linked with baseline pain sensitivity and pain intensity, and impair the beneficial EIH. Such information may better inform when individuals with LBP will have a beneficial effect of physical activity.},

	abstract = {Background: Pro‐nociceptive and anti‐nociceptive mechanisms are commonly assessed in clinical and experimental pain studies, but their potential interaction is not well understood.
Objectives: Investigate the effect of conditioning pain modulation (CPM) on temporal summation of pain (TSP).
Methods: Twenty healthy participants underwent cuff algometry assessment on the lower legs to establish the pressure pain tolerance threshold (PTT). For the TSP assessment, ten stimuli at the level of the PTT were delivered by computerised cuff inflations (1‐s stimulation, 1‐s break) while participants rated pain intensity on a 10cm electronic visual analogue scale (VAS). This TSP paradigm was then repeated with a simultaneous conditioning stimulus induced by a cuff on the contralateral leg, inflated to a constant pressure corresponding to 30\% (mild), 70\% (moderate) or 100\% (severe) of the PTT. These were assessed in a randomised order, with a fifteen‐minute break between tests. A final TSP test without conditioning was reassessed at the end (post‐recording).
Results: An interaction between stimuli (1–10) and repetition (p {\textless} 0.05) was found for VAS scores. VAS scores for the first stimulus were decreased during 30\%, 70\%, and 100\% conditioning intensities, compared to baseline and post‐recordings (p {\textless} 0.05). There was a significant increase in TSP during conditioning (p {\textless} 0.05). There were no significant differences between baseline and post‐recordings for any stimuli (p {\textgreater} 0.05).
Conclusions: The current study indicates that mild to severe stimuli administered by cuff algometry does not modulate summation effect of temporal summation of pain, which could indicate that pain facilitatory mechanisms are more potent compared with pain inhibitory mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Previous research showed that repetitive sensory stimulation entrains neural oscillations at the stimulation rate, facilitates long-term potentiation like perceptual learning, and improves behavioural performance. For example, short-time repetitive tactile stimulation improved tactile acuity measured with two-point or spatial orientation discrimination tests. The behavioural gain was maximal for a stimulation rate of 20 Hz, the same frequency at which repetitive somatosensory stimulation elicits a steady-state response with maximum amplitude. The current study investigated whether sensory stimulation must be strictly periodic to induce perceptual learning and whether the 20-Hz steady-state response plays a crucial role in the neural mechanisms of perceptual learning. In a crossover-designed experiment, young, healthy adults received sensory stimulation to the fingertip on three subsequent days. The stimulation was either periodic or temporally randomized (aperiodic) with the same number of stimuli. Tactile acuity was assessed with a grating orientation discrimination task, and brain activity was measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Stimulus type-by-session interactions were found for behavioural and brain data. Tactile acuity improved more after a session with aperiodic than periodic stimu­ lation. Beta-band 20-Hz steady-state responses were localized in the primary somatosensory cortex contralateral to the stimulated finger and had larger amplitudes after periodic than aperiodic stimulation. Both stimulus types also elicited gamma oscillations, which increased in amplitude more with aperiodic than periodic stimulation. Sensory stimuli caused a phase reset of sensorimotor beta oscillations phase-coupled to alpha oscillations. The system of stimulus-related oscillations was discussed as underlying temporal processing. Learning may result from facilitating the temporal code. More pronounced behavioural gain with aperiodic than periodic stimulation suggests beneficial effects of temporal stimulus variability for perceptual learning.},

	abstract = {The traditional concept that pain is poorly localized has been challenged by recent studies, where subjects were able to point to the stimulated spot on the skin with an accuracy of 10±20 mm. Pointing movements themselves, however, have errors of about 15 mm. To determine the limits of sensory performance of the nociceptive system independent of motor performance, point localization of heat pain (540 mJ punctate laser stimuli, 5 mm diameter), mechanical pain (256 mN punctate probe, 200 mm diameter), and touch (16 mN von Frey probe, 1.1 mm diameter) were tested in a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm in 12 healthy subjects. Stimuli were applied in randomized order to two parallel lines on the back of the hand (4±32 mm distance). The cumulative distribution functions for correct localization were of similar sigmoid shape for all test stimuli, indicating logarithmic normal distributions. The 75\% correct localization threshold for painful heat was 8.6 mm (3.1 {\textasciicircum} 0.1 log2 units) and did not differ signi®cantly from that of non-painful touch (9.0 mm, 3.2 {\textasciicircum} 0.2 log2 units). Localization of mechanically-induced pain (5.1 mm, 2.4 {\textasciicircum} 0.2 log2 units) was signi®cantly more accurate than both heat pain and touch, possibly due to a synergism of two different sensory channels, the tactile channel and the nociceptive channel, which were activated simultaneously. For all three stimuli, discrimination was signi®cantly better in radial±ulnar compared to proximal-distal direction, which might be related to oval receptive ®eld shapes. Sequential spatial discrimination for touch was signi®cantly better than simultaneous spatial discrimination tested with a grating orientation task (18.9 mm), but both were one order of magnitude worse than at the ®nger tip (1.3 mm, 0.4 {\textasciicircum} 0.1 log2 units). In conclusion, pain evoked by radiant heat pulses and touch evoked by von Frey probes were localized with similar precision on the back of the hand. These ®ndings indicate that outside the tactile fovea at ®nger tips or lips the spatial discrimination capacities of the nociceptive and tactile systems are about equal. q 2001 International Association for the Study of Pain.

	abstract = {The intraparietal sulcus region, which is part of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), has been shown to play an important role in discriminating object shapes using the ﬁngers. Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) and anodal transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS) are noninvasive strategies widely used to modulate neural activity in cortical regions. Therefore, we investigated the eﬀects of tRNS and anodal tPCS applied to left or right PPC on the tactile discrimination performance of the right index ﬁnger in 20 neurologically healthy subjects. A grating orientation task (GOT) was performed before and immediately after delivering tRNS (stimulus frequency 0.1–640 Hz) in Experiment 1 or anodal tPCS (pulse width 50 ms and inter-pulse interval 5 ms) in Experiment 2. Performing tRNS over the right PPC signiﬁcantly improved discrimination performance on the GOT. Subjects were classiﬁed into low and high baseline performance groups. Conducting tRNS over the left PPC signiﬁcantly reduced the GOT discrimination performance in the high-performance group. By contrast, anodal tPCS delivered to the PPC of the left and right hemispheres had no signiﬁcant eﬀect on the tactile GOT discrimination performance of the right hand. We show that transcranial electric stimulation over the PPC may improve tactile perception but the eﬀect depends on stimulus modality, parameters, and on the stimulated hemisphere.

	abstract = {Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) can be used to modulate inhibitory circuits in primary somatosensory cortex, resulting in improved somatosensory function. However, eﬃcacy may depend on the speciﬁc stimulus modality and patterns. For instance, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS), and transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS) were found to stably and eﬀectively modulate neuronal excitability, while anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) appeared less effective overall but with substantial response heterogeneity among subjects. Therefore, we compared the eﬀects of tES applied to primary somatosensory cortex on somatosensory evoked potential paired-pulse depression (SEP-PPD) and tactile discrimination performance in 17 neurologically healthy subjects. In Experiment 1, somatosensory evoked potential N20/P25\_SEP-PPD, N20\_SEP-PPD, and P25\_SEP-PPD responses were assessed before and immediately after anodal tDCS, tACS (stimulation frequency, 140 Hz), tRNS (stimulation frequency, 0.1–640 Hz), anodal tPCS (pulse width, 50 ms; inter-pulse interval, 5 ms), and sham stimulation applied to primary somatosensory cortex. In Experiment 2, a grating orientation task (GOT) was performed before and immediately after the same anodal tDCS, tRNS, anodal tPCS, and sham stimulation regimens. Anodal tDCS and anodal tPCS decreased N20\_SEP-PPD, and tRNS increased the ﬁrst N20 SEP amplitude. Furthermore, tRNS and anodal tPCS decreased GOT discrimination threshold (improved performance). These results suggest that tRNS and anodal tPCS can improve sensory perception by modulating neuronal activity in primary somatosensory cortex.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the acuity of the peripheral tactile system for gaps and to determine how stimulus orientation may impact on this. We quantified the ability of humans to discriminate small differences in gap width using a forced-choice task. Stimuli were presented passively to the distal fingerpad in a region where the skin ridges all run approximately in the same direction. Two standard gap widths were used (2 and 2.9 mm), and the comparison gap widths were larger than the standard gaps. With the gap axis parallel to the skin ridges, the average difference limen was approximately 0.2 mm for both standards. We examined the effect of stimulus orientation by asking subjects to discriminate between a smooth surface and a grating (ridge width, 1.5 mm; groove width, 0.75 mm). They were able to discriminate the two surfaces when the axis of the grooves was parallel to the skin ridges, but performance was below threshold in the orthogonal orientation. The underlying neural mechanisms were investigated using the gap stimuli to activate single slowly adapting type I mechanoreceptive afferents (SAIs) innervating the fingerpads of anesthetized monkeys. The edges of the gap produced response peaks, and the gap resulted in a trough in the receptive field profiles. The response magnitude at the peaks was greater, and at the troughs was smaller, for larger gap widths and also when the axis of the gap was parallel to the skin ridges as compared with the orthogonal orientation. Simulated SAI population responses showed that response profiles were distorted by variation in afferent sensitivity and by neural noise. Using signal detection theory, based on a neural measure of the gaps computed over the active population, the acuity of the SAIs under realistic population conditions was compared with human performance. These analyses showed how parameters like afferent sensitivity, the pattern and density of innervation, and noise impact on performance and why their impact is different for the two stimulus orientations investigated. The greatest limitation was imposed by noise that is independent of response magnitude, and this effect was greater for stimuli oriented orthogonal to the skin ridges than for the parallel orientation.},

Peripheral electrical stimulation (PES) is widely used to induce selective aﬀerent activation, and its eﬀect may depend on PES intensity. Therefore, we investigated the eﬀects of high- and lowintensity PES applied to the right index ﬁnger on tactile discrimination performance and cortical somatosensory-evoked potential paired-pulse depression (SEP-PPD) in 25 neurologically healthy subjects. In Experiment 1, a grating orientation task (GOT) was performed before and immediately after local high- and lowintensity PES (both delivered as 1-s, 20-Hz trains of 0.2-ms electrical pulses at 5-s intervals). In Experiment 2, PPD of SEP components N20/P25\_SEP-PPD, N20\_SEP-PPD and P25\_SEP-PPD, respectively, were assessed before and immediately after high- and low-intensity PES. Improved GOT discrimination performance after high-intensity PES (reduced discrimination threshold) was associated with lower baseline performance (higher baseline discrimination threshold). Subjects were classiﬁed into low and high (baseline) GOT performance groups. Improved GOT discrimination performance in the low GOT performance group was signiﬁcantly associated with a greater N20\_SEP-PPD decrease (weaker PPD). Subjects were also classiﬁed into GOT improvement and GOT decrement groups. High-intensity PES decreased N20\_SEP-PPD in the GOT improvement group but increased N20\_SEP-PPD in the GOT decrement group. Furthermore, a greater decrease in GOT discrimination threshold was signiﬁcantly associated with a greater N20\_SEP-PPD decrease in the GOT improvement group. These results suggest that high-intensity PES can improve somatosensory perception in subjects with low baseline function by modulating cortical inhibitory circuits in primary somatosensory cortex.

	abstract = {Understanding food texture sensitivity in children is important in guiding food selection. The objective of this work was to develop a short questionnaire that could be completed by parents in nonclinical settings to provide a categorization for food texture sensitivity in children. This study evaluated the distribution of children as texture sensitive (TS) or non-texture sensitive (NTS) and the predictive validity of these questions to explain rejection of specific food textures. Three sets of survey data were examined, including data from a home-use test (HUT) in children with and without Down syndrome (DS), and lingual tactile sensitivity measured by grating orientation task (GOT). From three parent-completed surveys, the use of the questionnaire yielded a similar distribution of children in the TS category (16–22\%) as previously reported. TS children (4–36 months) were more likely to reject specific food textures, including chewy, hard, lumpy, and “tough meat” (p {\textless} .05). A higher percentage of children with a diagnosis of DS were TS (36.9\%). Children who were TS showed increased negative behaviors to foods and ate less than NTS children. In older children (5–12 years), TS children were fussier than NTS children (p {\textless} .001). Lingual tactile sensitivity was not significantly different by TS/NTS categorization (p = .458). This study demonstrated that the use of these five questions specific to food texture provides a useful tool in categorizing a child as TS/NTS, with this information being useful in selecting preferred food textures. Future studies involving these TS questions should perform psychometric assessments and measures of criterion validity using other questionnaires.},

One of the measures based on intensive cues is the smooth-grooved (SM/GV) task, and the two other measures based on spatial cues are the grating orientation and gap detection tasks. Measures were made at two locations that vary in sensitivity and in the density of innervation of the primary afferent fibers, the right index fingerpad and the palmar surface of the proximal phalanx (fingerbase). At each location, psychometric functions were generated for each of the three measures for two forces (50 and 200 g). The results indicated that increasing force led to marked improvement on the task that relied on intensive cues; however, on the tasks that relied on spatial cues, force had no effect on performance. Biomechanical measures were made of the depth to which the skin invades the grooves of the contactors (conformance) at the two test sites, with the two forces, and with different groove widths. Conformance was found to be a joint function of force and groove width. Further, performance on the SM/GV task could be predicted by the amount of conformance. The psychophysical results are consistent with the view that increasing conformance increases neural activity in the primary afferent fibers, and that this increase in neural activity improves SM/GV performance, but has little effect on the quality of the spatial image.

	abstract = {Current ﬁndings suggest that conﬁdence emerges only after decision making. However, the temporal and neural dynamics of the emergence of post-decision conﬁdence – a metacognitive judgement – are not fully explored. To gain insight into the dynamics of post-decision conﬁdence processing and to disentangle the processes underlying conﬁdence judgements and decision making, we applied a tactile discrimination task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Our results revealed that reaction times to post-decision conﬁdence depend on the level of conﬁdence, suggesting that post-decision conﬁdence in a perceptual choice is not processed in parallel to perceptual decision making. Moreover, we demonstrated by the parametric analysis of fMRI data that postdecisionally modelled conﬁdence processing can be distinguished from processes related to decision making through anatomical location and through the pattern of neural activity. In contrast to perceptual decision making, post-decision conﬁdence appears to be strictly allocated to a prefrontal network of brain regions, primarily the anterior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, areas that have been related to metacognition. Moreover, the processes underlying decision making and post-decision conﬁdence may share recruitment of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, although the former probably has distinct functions with regard to processing of perceptual choices and post-decision conﬁdence. Thus, this is the ﬁrst fMRI study to disentangle the processes underlying post-decision conﬁdence and decision making on behavioural, neuroanatomical, and neurofunctional levels. With regard to the temporal evolution of post-decision conﬁdence, results of the present study provide strong support for the most recent theoretical models of human perceptual decision making, and thus provide implications for investigating conﬁdence in perceptual paradigms.},

	abstract = {We investigated the effect of repeated delivery of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on somatosensory performance and long-term learning. Over the course of ﬁve days, tDCS was applied to the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) by means of neuronavigation employing magnetencephalography (MEG). Compared to its sham application, tDCS promoted tactile learning by reducing the two-point discrimination threshold assessed by the grating orientation task (GOT) primarily by affecting intersessional changes in performance. These results were accompanied by alterations in the neurofunctional organization of the brain, as revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging conducted prior to the study, at the ﬁfth day of tDCS delivery and four weeks after the last application of tDCS. A decrease in activation at the primary site of anodal tDCS delivery in the left S1 along retention of superior tactile acuity was observed at follow-up four weeks after the application of tDCS. Thus, we demonstrate long-term effects that repeated tDCS imposes on somatosensory functioning. This is the ﬁrst study to provide insight into the mode of operation of tDCS on the brain’s response to long-term perceptual learning, adding an important piece of evidence from the domain of noninvasive brain stimulation to show that functional changes detectable by fMRI in primary sensory cortices participate in perceptual learning.

We used gratings of alternating ridges and grooves to investigate tactile perception in this disorder using two tasks: spatial acuity-dependent discrimination of grating orientation and discrimination of gratings varying in ridge width. Compared to age-matched normal subjects, dyslexics were signi®cantly impaired on grating orientation discrimination, with mean thresholds that were nearly twice normal. Unlike normal subjects, their performance on this task was slightly but signi®cantly worse on the dominant hand than on the non-dominant hand. Dyslexics also showed a substantial but nonsigni®cant trend for impairment on grating ridge width discrimination. A group of subjects with attention de®cit disorder did not dier signi®cantly from normal on any of these measures.

	title = {Tactile perception and manual dexterity in computer users},
	abstract = {Recent studies suggest that sensory input generated during highly repetitive tasks can degrade the sensory representation of the hand and eventually lead to sensory and motor problems. In this study, we investigated whether early changes in tactile perception and manual dexterity could be detected in persons exposed to computer tasks. Performance in tests designed to assess tactile perception (grating orientation task for spatial acuity and roughness discrimination) and manual dexterity (grooved pegboard test) was compared between two groups of healthy individuals, matched for age, gender, and experience, who differed in terms of computer habits. One group consisted of frequent users (FU, {\textgreater} 2 h/day, n = 36) and the other of non or occasional users (OU, {\textless} 2 h/day, n = 28). Comparison of performance between groups with subjects sorted by gender revealed significant differences (t-test, p {\textless} 0.05) in female, but not male, participants. Grating resolution thresholds at the tip on the second and fifth digits were, on average, 40\% higher in female FU (n = 13) than in female OU (n = 10) and performance scores on the dexterity test were significantly higher for the left hand. The results of this study indicate that early signs of deterioration in hand function can be present in persons constantly exposed to computer tasks and that these signs are more readily apparent in women than in men. The loss of tactile spatial acuity found in female FU possibly reflect an early consequence of the degraded sensory representation of the hand resulting from constant repetitions of fine motor tasks.},

	abstract = {Sensory feedback from cutaneous mechanoreceptors in the fingertips is important in effective object manipulation, allowing appropriate scaling of grip and load forces during precision grip. However, the role of mechanoreceptor subtypes in these tasks remains incompletely understood. To address this issue, psychophysical tasks that may specifically assess function of type I fast-adapting (FAI) and slowly adapting (SAI) mechanoreceptors were used with object manipulation experiments to examine the regulation of grip force control in an experimental model of graded reduction in tactile sensitivity (healthy volunteers wearing 2 layers of latex gloves). With gloves, tactile sensitivity decreased significantly from 1.9 ± 0.4 to 12.3 ± 2.2 μm in the Bumps task assessing function of FAI afferents but not in a grating orientation task assessing SAI afferents (1.6 ± 0.1 to 1.8 ± 0.2 mm). Six axis force/torque sensors measured peak grip (PGF) and load (PLF) forces generated by the fingertips during a grip-lift task. With gloves there was a significant increase of PGF (14 ± 6\%), PLF (17 ± 5\%), and grip and load force rates (26 ± 8\%, 20 ± 8\%). A variable-weight series task was used to examine sensorimotor memory. There was a 20\% increase in PGF when the lift of a light object was preceded by a heavy relative to a light object. This relationship was not significantly altered when lifting with gloves, suggesting that the addition of gloves did not change sensorimotor memory effects. We conclude that FAI fibers may be important for the online force scaling but not for the buildup of a sensorimotor memory.},

	abstract = {Objective: To test the tactile spatial resolution in chronic unilateral brain lesions. Additionally, since sensory deficits are thought to have an impact on motor deficits, this study investigated the correlation between tactile spatial resolution and finger dexterity. Design: Descriptive cross-sectional study. Patients: Twenty-two patients with unilateral brain lesions (12 children with congenital hemiplegia and 10 patients after stroke).
Methods: Tactile spatial resolution was measured with a grating orientation task, and finger dexterity with the Purdue Pegboard Test.
Results: Major tactile spatial resolution deficits were measured on the paretic hand and preserved abilities on the nonparetic hand, both in children with congenital hemiplegia and in patients after stroke. No correlation was found between the deficits of tactile spatial resolution and digital dexterity in the paretic hand (r = 0.126; p = 0.572).
Conclusion: The specific location of tactile spatial resolution deficits on the hand contralateral to the lesion was surprising when one considers the left hemispheric dominance of tactile spatial resolution in healthy subjects. The absence of correlation between tactile spatial resolution and dexterity deficits suggest that these abilities are not related, suggesting that they should be considered separately and equally integrated into the rehabilitation of unilateral brain lesions.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate tactile anisotropy on human lips.
Methods: Spatial tactile acuity was assessed with a three-alternative, forced-choice grating orientation task. Circular probes with horizontal (parallel to lip), vertical (perpendicular to lip), or oblique (45° right of vertical) grooves and ridges of equal width were applied (n = 60) to the midline of each lip. Participants (n = 13) were asked to state the grating orientation whilst blindfolded. The percentage of correct responses was plotted as a function of the log gap width. Data were ﬁtted with a four-parameter sigmoid function. Response bias was assessed (n = 13) with application of a smooth polished Perspex probe. 65.5\%, 71.5\%, and 63.0\% correct was adopted as the threshold estimate for the vertical, horizontal, and oblique orientations based on the measured response bias.
Results: Across orientations, the threshold on the upper lip (1.5 ± 0.9 mm) was signiﬁcantly greater than on the lower lip (1.0 ± 0.7 mm; P = 0.006). However, there was no signiﬁcant main effect of orientation or orientation-by-lip interaction on threshold.
Conclusion: Tactile anisotropy is absent on human lips. Signiﬁcance: The lack of anisotropy is surprising given that anisotropy is present on ﬁngers and that afferent input and sensory processing for human lips and ﬁngers share similarities.

	abstract = {Background: Deﬁcit of tactile sensation in patients with MS is frequent and can be associated with interference with daily life activities. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) showed to increase tactile discrimination in healthy subjects.
Objective: In the present study, we investigated whether tDCS may be effective in ameliorating tactile sensory deﬁcit in MS patients.
Methods: Patients received sham or real anodal tDCS of the somatosensory cortex for 5 consecutive days in a randomized, double blind, sham-controlled study. Discrimination thresholds of spatial tactile sensation were measured using the grating orientation task (GOT). As secondary outcomes we also measured subjective perception of tactile sensory deﬁcit through a visual analog scale (VAS), quality of life and overall disability to evaluate the impact of the treatment on patients daily life. Evaluations were performed at baseline and during a 4-week follow-up period.
Results: Following anodal but not sham tDCS over the somatosensory cortex, there was a signiﬁcant improvement of discriminatory thresholds at the GOT and increased VAS for sensation scores. Quality of life, and disability changes were not observed.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that a ﬁve day course of anodal tDCS is able to ameliorate tactile sensory loss with long-lasting beneﬁcial effects and could thus represent a therapeutic tool for the treatment of tactile sensory deﬁcit in MS patients.},

	abstract = {Objective—Non-invasive brain stimulation such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been successfully used to induce polarity-specific excitability changes in the brain. However, it is still unknown if anodal tDCS (tDCSanodal) applied to the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) can lead to behavioral changes in performance of tactile discriminative tasks.
Methods—Using an accurate tactile discrimination task (grating orientation task: GOT) we tested the hypothesis that application of 1 mA of tDCSanodal (current density at the electrodes of 0.04 mA/ cm2) over the left S1 can lead to an improved tactile spatial acuity in the contralateral index-finger (IF).
Results—Performance in the GOT task with the contralateral IF but not with the ipsilateral IF was enhanced for about 40 min after a 20 min application of tDCSanodal in the absence of changes with sham stimulation.
Conclusion—These results provide the first evidence that tDCSanodal over S1 improves performance in a complex somatosensory task beyond the period of stimulation.},

In this task, subjects are required to identify the orientation of square-wave gratings placed on the skin. Previous studies have shown that performance varies as a function of the width of the grooves in the gratings. In the present study, both groove width and the overall size and con® guration of the contactors were varied. Sensitivity improved with wider grooves and with larger contactors. Additional m easurements showed that the improved sensitivity is not the result of the increase in total area contacted, but rather is due to two other factors associated with larger contactors. One is the greater linear extent of the larger contactors. The other appears to be due to the reduction in the interference produced by the outer edge of the contactor. Speci® cally, as the contactor increases in size, the distance between the outer edge and the center portion of the grooves also increases. It was also shown that subjects are m ore sensitive to a single, continuous groove as compared with two grooves of the same total length but spatially discontinuous. Similarly, subjects are more sensitive to a contactor with a continuous groove than to a contactor in which just the end points of the groove are presented. The results are generally consistent with the results of peripheral, neurophysiological recordings. The results are discussed in terms of the way in which both spatial and intensive factors m ay affect sensitivity to grating orientation.},

	abstract = {Tactile acuity is known to decline with age in adults, possibly as the result of receptor loss, but less is understood about how tactile acuity changes during childhood. Previous research from our laboratory has shown that fingertip size influences tactile spatial acuity in young adults: those with larger fingers tend to have poorer acuity, possibly because mechanoreceptors are more sparsely distributed in larger fingers. We hypothesized that a similar relationship would hold among children. If so, children’s tactile spatial acuity might be expected to worsen as their fingertips grow. However, concomitant CNS maturation might result in more efficient perceptual processing, counteracting the effect of fingertip growth on tactile acuity. To investigate, we conducted a cross-sectional study, testing 116 participants ranging in age from 6 to 16 years on a precision-controlled tactile grating orientation task. We measured each participant's grating orientation threshold on the dominant index finger, along with physical properties of the fingertip: surface area, volume, sweat pore spacing, and temperature. We found that, as in adults, children with larger fingertips (at a given age) had significantly poorer acuity, yet paradoxically acuity did not worsen significantly with age. We propose that finger growth during development results in a gradual decline in innervation density as receptive fields reposition to cover an expanding skin surface. At the same time, central maturation presumably enhances perceptual processing.},

We compared the passive tactile acuity of blind and sighted subjects on a fully automated grating orientation task and used multivariate Bayesian data analysis to determine predictors of acuity. Acuity was significantly superior in blind subjects, independently of the degree of childhood vision, light perception level, or Braille reading. Acuity was strongly dependent on the force of contact between the stimulus surface and the skin, declined with subject age, and was better in women than in men. Despite large intragroup variability, the difference between blind and sighted subjects was highly significant: the average blind subject had the acuity of an average sighted subject of the same gender but 23 years younger. The results suggest that crossmodal plasticity may underlie tactile acuity enhancement in blindness.},

The present study investigates whether a bimanual intensive intervention improves tactile function. Nineteen children with USCP received 90 hours of bimanual training without enriched environment. Primary outcomes: Manual Form Perception Test/MFPT, Grating Orientation Task/GOT. Children were assessed before, after the training, and at the 4-month follow-up. Significant improvements were observed in MFPT for the more affected hand (P ¼ .015). Larger stereognosis/MFPT improvements correlated with poorer baseline motor function. Intensive bimanual training alone was sufficient to improve stereognosis, though no improvement in GOT was observed. Present and previously published findings suggest that environmental tactile enrichment incorporated into a bimanual motor training may be needed to improve spatial discrimination/GOT in children with USCP.},

	abstract = {An important unresolved question in sensory neuroscience is whether, and if so with what time course, tactile perception is enhanced by visual deprivation. In three experiments involving 158 normally sighted human participants, we assessed whether tactile spatial acuity improves with short-term visual deprivation over periods ranging from under 10 to over 110 minutes. We used an automated, precisely controlled two-interval forced-choice grating orientation task to assess each participant’s ability to discern the orientation of square-wave gratings pressed against the stationary index finger pad of the dominant hand. A two-down one-up staircase (Experiment 1) or a Bayesian adaptive procedure (Experiments 2 and 3) was used to determine the groove width of the grating whose orientation each participant could reliably discriminate. The experiments consistently showed that tactile grating orientation discrimination does not improve with short-term visual deprivation. In fact, we found that tactile performance degraded slightly but significantly upon a brief period of visual deprivation (Experiment 1) and did not improve over periods of up to 110 minutes of deprivation (Experiments 2 and 3). The results additionally showed that grating orientation discrimination tends to improve upon repeated testing, and confirmed that women significantly outperform men on the grating orientation task. We conclude that, contrary to two recent reports but consistent with an earlier literature, passive tactile spatial acuity is not enhanced by short-term visual deprivation. Our findings have important theoretical and practical implications. On the theoretical side, the findings set limits on the time course over which neural mechanisms such as crossmodal plasticity may operate to drive sensory changes; on the practical side, the findings suggest that researchers who compare tactile acuity of blind and sighted participants should not blindfold the sighted participants.},

	abstract = {Continuous training enhances perceptual discrimination and promotes neural changes in areas encoding the experienced stimuli. This type of experience-dependent plasticity has been demonstrated in several sensory and motor systems. Particularly, non-human primates trained to detect consecutive tactile bar indentations across multiple digits showed expanded excitatory receptive fields (RFs) in somatosensory cortex. However, the perceptual implications of these anatomical changes remain undetermined. Here, we trained human participants for 9 days on a tactile task that promoted expansion of multi-digit RFs. Participants were required to detect consecutive indentations of bar stimuli spanning multiple digits. Throughout the training regime we tracked participants’ discrimination thresholds on spatial (grating orientation) and temporal tasks on the trained and untrained hands in separate sessions. We hypothesized that training on the multi-digit task would decrease perceptual thresholds on tasks that require stimulus processing across multiple digits, while also increasing thresholds on tasks requiring discrimination on single digits. We observed an increase in orientation thresholds on a single digit. Importantly, this effect was selective for the stimulus orientation and hand used during multi-digit training. We also found that temporal acuity between digits improved across trained digits, suggesting that discriminating the temporal order of multi-digit stimuli can transfer to temporal discrimination of other tactile stimuli. These results suggest that experience-dependent plasticity following perceptual learning improves and interferes with tactile abilities in manners predictive of the task and stimulus features used during training.},

	abstract = {Previous psychophysical studies have reported conflicting results concerning the effects of short-term visual deprivation upon tactile acuity. Some studies have found that 45 to 90 minutes of total light deprivation produce significant improvements in participants’ tactile acuity as measured with a grating orientation discrimination task. In contrast, a single 2011 study found no such improvement while attempting to replicate these earlier findings. A primary goal of the current experiment was to resolve this discrepancy in the literature by evaluating the effects of a 90-minute period of total light deprivation upon tactile grating orientation discrimination. We also evaluated the potential effect of short-term deprivation upon haptic 3-D shape discrimination using a set of naturally-shaped solid objects. According to previous research, shortterm deprivation enhances performance in a tactile 2-D shape discrimination task – perhaps a similar improvement also occurs for haptic 3-D shape discrimination. The results of the current investigation demonstrate that not only does shortterm visual deprivation not enhance tactile acuity, it additionally has no effect upon haptic 3-D shape discrimination. While visual deprivation had no effect in our study, there was a significant effect of experience and learning for the grating orientation task – the participants’ tactile acuity improved over time, independent of whether they had, or had not, experienced visual deprivation.},

Methods: Nine healthy adults participated in this double-blind, sham-controlled, and cross-over design study. The performance in a grating orientation task (GOT) in the right index ﬁnger was evaluated before, during, immediately after and 30 min after the dual-hemisphere, uni-hemisphere (1 mA, 20 min), or sham tDCS (1 mA, 30 s) over S1. In the dual-hemisphere and sham conditions, anodal tDCS was applied over the left S1, and cathodal tDCS was applied over the right S1. In the uni-hemisphere condition, anodal tDCS was applied over the left S1, and cathodal tDCS was applied over the contralateral supraorbital front.
Results: The percentage of correct responses on the GOT during dual-hemisphere tDCS was signiﬁcantly higher than that in the uni-hemisphere or sham tDCS conditions when the grating width was set to 0.75 mm (all p {\textless} 0.05).
Conclusions: Dual-hemisphere tDCS over S1 improved performance in a tactile spatial discrimination task in healthy volunteers.

	abstract = {For assessing tactile spatial resolution it has recently been recommended to use tactile acuity charts which follow the design principles of the Snellen letter charts for visual acuity and involve active touch. However, it is currently unknown whether acuity thresholds obtained with this newly developed psychophysical procedure are in accordance with established measures of tactile acuity that involve passive contact with fixed duration and control of contact force. Here we directly compared tactile acuity thresholds obtained with the acuity charts to traditional two-point and grating orientation thresholds in a group of young healthy adults. For this purpose, two types of charts, using either Braille-like dot patterns or embossed Landolt rings with different orientations, were adapted from previous studies. Measurements with the two types of charts were equivalent, but generally more reliable with the dot pattern chart. A comparison with the two-point and grating orientation task data showed that the test-retest reliability of the acuity chart measurements after one week was superior to that of the passive methods. Individual thresholds obtained with the acuity charts agreed reasonably with the grating orientation threshold, but less so with the two-point threshold that yielded relatively distinct acuity estimates compared to the other methods. This potentially considerable amount of mismatch between different measures of tactile acuity suggests that tactile spatial resolution is a complex entity that should ideally be measured with different methods in parallel. The simple test procedure and high reliability of the acuity charts makes them a promising complement and alternative to the traditional two-point and grating orientation thresholds.},

To examine whether tACS can actually improve tactile perception via alpha and gamma modulation, we measured the effects of 10-Hz and 70-Hz tACS (α- and γ-tACS) on the left somatosensory cortex on right-finger tactile spatial orientation discrimination, and the associations between performance changes and individual alpha and gamma activities. Methods Fifteen neurologically healthy subjects were recruited into this study. Electroencephalography (EEG) was performed before the first day, to assess the normal alpha- and gamma-activity levels. A grating orientation discrimination task was performed before and during 10-Hz and 70-Hz tACS. Results The 10-Hz tACS protocol decreased the grating orientation discrimination threshold, primarily in subjects with low alpha event-related synchronization (ERS). In contrast, the 70-Hz tACS had no effect on the grating orientation discrimination threshold. Conclusions This study showed that 10-Hz tACS can improve tactile orientation discrimination in subjects with low alpha activity. Alpha-frequency tACS may help identify the contributions of these oscillations to other neurophysiological and pathological processes.},

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural circuitry underlying performance of this task. Two studies were carried out. In the ﬁrst study, an extensive set of parietal and frontal cortical areas was activated during covert task performance, relative to a rest baseline. The active regions included the postcentral sulcus bilaterally and foci in the left parietal operculum, left anterior intraparietal sulcus, and bilateral premotor and prefrontal cortex. The second study examined selective recruitment of cortical areas during discrimination of grating orientation (a task with a macrospatial component) compared to discrimination of grating spacing (a purely microspatial task). The foci activated on this contrast were in the left anterior intraparietal sulcus, right postcentral sulcus and gyrus, left parieto-occipital cortex, bilateral frontal eye ﬁelds, and bilateral ventral premotor cortex. These ﬁndings not only conﬁrm and extend previous studies of the neural processing underlying grating orientation discrimination, but also demonstrate that a distributed network of putatively multisensory areas is involved.

	abstract = {Recent studies have used grating orientation as a m easure of tactile spatial acuity on the fingerpad. In this task subjects identify the orientation of a grooved surface presented in either the proximal± distal or lateral± m edial orientation. Other recent results have suggested that there might be a substantial anisotropy on the fingerpad related to spatial sensitivity. This anisotropy was revealed using a task in which subjects discriminated between a smooth and a grooved surface presented at different orientations on the fingerpad. The anisotropy was substantial enough that it might permit subjects to discriminate grating orientation on the basis of intensive rather than spatial cues. The present study exam ined the possibility that anisotropy on the fingerpad might provide cues in a spatial acuity task. The ability of subjects to discriminate between a smooth and a grooved surface was m easured under conditions that are typically used in grating orientation tasks. No evidence of anisotropy was found. Also, using a grating orientation task, separate estimates were made of sensitivity in the proxim al ± distal and lateral ± m edial orientations. Again no evidence of anisotropy was found. Consistent with changes in the density of innervation, grating orientation sensitivity was found to vary as a function of location on the fingerpad. The results support the view that grating orientation is a valid measure of spatial acuity reflecting underlying neural, spatial m e ch a n is m s.},

	abstract = {Perceptual learning generally improves with training intensity, but the number of training trials sufﬁcient for transient and long-term improvement in tactile grating orientation task (GOT) discrimination has not been systematically studied. To deﬁne reliable trial numbers for tactile discrimination learning, we compared tactile orientation discrimination performance of the right-ﬁnger following 200 and 400 training trials. Fifty-one neurologically healthy subjects were recruited. Tactile spatial acuity for orientation (parallel or orthogonal to the long axis of the ﬁnger) across different grating frequencies was assessed before, immediately after, 30 min after, and 24 h after sessions consisting of 200 training trials (50/block Â 4 blocks), 400 training trials (50/block Â 8 blocks), or no training (sham control). Both the 200- and 400trial training conditions reduced the grating orientation discrimination threshold at 24 h after training. In contrast, the control condition had no effect on the grating orientation discrimination threshold. There was a negative correlation between the baseline grating orientation discrimination threshold and training-induced change in threshold (improvement) following both 200 and 400 trials. Fewer GOT trials (200) substantially prolong tactile discrimination learning, presumably by promoting the consolidation of the underlying neuroplastic mechanisms. In this widely used perceptual learning paradigm, 200 and 400 training trials appear effective for inducing short-term and long-term perceptual memory. Ó 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The stimuli of commonly used sensibility measurement instruments tested in this study demonstrate unequivocally that "hand-held instruments" produce variations in appli cation force from one stimulation to another, one instrument to another, and from one examiner to another. These application force variations cannot be compensated for by care in technique and need to be controlled for measurement reliability. Only the Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments provide some control of force during application and can be considered force controlled if calibrated and applied correctly. The monofilaments, too, become less controllable if applied too quickly and bounced against the skin. Two-point discrimination instruments, in particular, lack control of application force, with the force of one point significantly different from two points. A difference in applied force makes it possible for a patient to solve the two-point discrimination test by discerning the difference between heavier and lighter forces, rather than one or two-point recognition. Tuning fork instruments for vibration testing have even larger variations in application force amplitude rendering their stimulus highly uncontrolled and masking the actual vibration of the tuning fork. Spectral analysis of the force frequency signal produced by hand held sensibility measurement instruments shows they all produce both high and low frequency signals sufficient in strength to stimulate both slowly adapting and quickly adapting end organs, and are not capable of stimulating one particular group. These dynamic properties of testing stimuli explain why our tests are not as repeatable and sensitive as desired. The understanding of these dynamic properties in sensibility measurement is a key for improved instruments and more repeatable findings in clinical testing.},

	abstract = {Many patients undergoing orthognathic surgery experience some degree of neurosensory impairment as a normal consequence of surgery. This may also occur as a complication after mandibular third molar surgery. The condition is usually reversible, but it may also be permanent. Neurosensory tests are essential in making decisions regarding the nature of the nerve injury, the potential for recovery, and the possible need for secondary microneurosurgical intervention. The aim of this study was to evaluate the repeatability of 5 clinical neurosensory tests assessing the neurosensory function of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN). Twenty healthy subjects (9 males, 11 females) ranging in age from 21 years to 27 years participated in this study. The methods of assessment were light touch (LT), 2-point discrimination (2-P), pin tactile discrimination (PIN), thermal discrimination, and sensibility (ST) testing of the mandibular teeth with a vitality scanner. All the measurements were evaluated by 2 examiners and repeated at an interval of 6 months. In the statistical analysis, intraexaminer and interexaminer variability, as well as the variability between the 2 observations at a 6-month interval, were calculated. All the subjects reacted positively to LT and thermal discrimination in every observation. For the 2-P and PIN tests, intraexaminer variability was smaller than interexaminer variability, and repeatability of the 2 observations at 6 months was also good. Repeatability of ST was best at incisors, but it was not numerically very accurate at any site. However, all teeth that reacted positively to the vitality scanner in the first observation also reacted positively in the second observation; this instrument thus provides a more meaningful measurement of neurosensory function as a positive/negative assessment than as a numeric value.},

The interpretation of these findings is based on the assumption that the measures are stable and reproducible. To date, reliability of QST has been investigated for short test-retest intervals. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term reliability of a multimodal QST assessment in healthy people, with testing conducted on 3 occasions over 4 months. Forty-two healthy people were enrolled in the study. Static and dynamic tests were performed, including cold and heat pain threshold (CPT, HPT), mechanical wind-up [wind-up ratio (WUR)], pressure pain threshold (PPT), 2-point discrimination (TPD), and conditioned pain modulation (CPM). Systematic bias, relative reliability and agreement were analysed using repeated measure analysis of variance, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs3,1) and SE of the measurement (SEM), respectively. Static QST (CPT, HPT, PPT, and TPD) showed good-to-excellent reliability (ICCs: 0.68-0.90). Dynamic QST (WUR and CPM) showed poor-to-good reliability (ICCs: 0.35-0.61). A significant linear decrease over time was observed for mechanical QST at the back (PPT and TPD) and for CPM (P , 0.01). Static QST were stable over a period of 4 months; however, a small systematic decrease over time has been observed for mechanical QST. Dynamic QST showed considerable variability over time; in particular, CPM using PPT as the test stimulus did not show adequate reliability, suggesting that this test paradigm may be less useful for monitoring individuals over time.},

However, low inter-examiner reliability and difﬁculties in execution signiﬁcantly limit its application. Therefore the aim of this study was to compare the inter- and intra-examiner reliability of a new approach, the pointto-point test (PTP), with the TPD. Twenty-one pain-free subjects attended the inter-examiner stage of the study. Eighteen of them were further recruited into an intra-examiner (reproducibility and repeatability) reliability study. PTP was performed on the three points plotted at the L3 spinal level. Point ‘0’ overlapped with the L3 spinous process, from which points ‘1’ and ‘2’ were horizontally separated by 5 and 10 cm, respectively. Participants manually indicated a point previously touched by the examiner, while the distance (error) was measured. Reliability was determined with the intraclass correlation coefﬁcient (ICC2,3). The results revealed good and moderate inter- and intra-examiner reliability at point ‘1’ (ICC2,3 ¼ 0.68e0.84) and good reliability at point ‘2’ (ICC2,3 ¼ 0.84e0.86). At point ‘0’, reliability was moderate to poor (ICC2,3 ¼ 0.13e0.63). TPD was characterised by a poor to moderate level of inter(ICC2,1 ¼ 0.51; ICC2,3 ¼ 0.56) and intra-examiner reliability (ICC(2,1) ¼ 0.50; ICC2,3 ¼ 0.74). Our ﬁndings suggest that PTP is more reliable than TPD at two investigated points at the L3 spinal level. However, further research on PTP validity data is strongly warranted.},

While use of a bent paperclip with a specified intertip distance as the assessment device has been described, no research has been performed on the accuracy of setting this distance by hand and eye alone. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate this accuracy.
Methods: Five orthopaedic registrars, four residents and three clinic nurses performed static and dynamic two-point discrimination testing on each other. They set the tip distance by hand and eye by bending a paperclip such that the distance between the two ends was their best approximation of 5 mm and then 10 mm. The testing was repeated after 7 days, n = 264 for each tip distance.
Results: Two-sample t-tests showed no significant difference (P {\textgreater} 0.53–0.93) between tip distance setting performed by registrars, nurses and residents; while single sample t-test showed a statistically significant difference (P {\textless} 0.0001) between the attempted tip distance and the overall mean tip distance achieved at 5 mm and 10 mm.
Conclusion: Statistical analysis showed that the single sample t-test could be discarded. Static and dynamic two-point discrimination testing with a paperclip set by hand and eye is therefore an accurate and reproducible test capable of being administered by both medical and non-medical staff, and is suitable for inclusion in a peripheral nerve repair testing protocol.},

	abstract = {Objectives. Sensory dissociation (SEDI), the discrepancy between perception and actual size or shape of a painful body part, is a frequently observed ﬁnding in patients with chronic low back pain. However, the current methods of evaluating SEDI have several limitations, such as a qualitative nature and weak evidence supporting their reliability. In the current study, the reliability of two versions (manual and verbal) of a novel test, a two-point estimation task (TPE), was investigated. Methods. To perform the manual version of the task, patients estimated the distance between two tactile stimuli delivered to their back using callipers, whereas in the verbal version they verbally reported the estimated distance. Results. The manual version of TPE showed greater interexaminer reliability than the verbal version, and the mean of the two repeated measurements was sufﬁcient for reaching excellent reliability for the pain-free (intraclass correlation coefﬁcient [ICC] ¼ 0.91, 95\% conﬁdence interval [CI] ¼ 0.77–0.97) and painful (ICC ¼ 0.86, 95\% CI ¼ 0.65–0.94) sides. Intra-examiner reliability was moderate to excellent (ICC ¼ 0.66–0.96) for the manual version performed at the pain-free and painful sides. Distribution, duration, and intensity of pain signiﬁcantly predicted SEDI and accounted for 42\% of the total variance (corrected R2 ¼ 0.42, P {\textless} 0.01). Conclusions. TPE showed higher reliability coefﬁcients compared with tools previously suggested in the literature and can therefore be used clinically and experimentally by one or more examiners. Further research is required to investigate the validity of this new test.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The two-point discrimination (2PD) test is widely used in clinical practice to assess tactile acuity and central somatosensory function in stroke patients.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of 2PD test in ﬁngers on the affected and non-affected sides in acute stroke patients.
METHODS: This was a single group repeated-measures inter-rater reliability study. Thirty adults with completed ischemic stroke and left paresis participated in the study. Static 2PD sensation was assessed using a standardized Dellon discriminator. Two examiners performed measurements of 2PD sensation on both hands. Each examiner made three series of measurements at intervals of 1 minute. After 15 minutes, the study was conducted in the same order by a second examiner.
RESULTS: The ability for 2PD sensation was signiﬁcantly reduced in all examined ﬁngers on the affected side in comparison to the non-affected side. The difference was statistically signiﬁcant (in each case, p {\textless} 0.0001). Inter-rater reliability (ICC2,1) for the ﬁrst measurement at the affected site ranged from 0.95 to 0.98; at the non-affected site ranged from 0.30 to 0.82. Analysis of the average value of three measurements (ICC2,3) yielded values for the affected site ranging from 0.98 to 0.99; at the non-affected site ranged from 0.81 to 0.95.
CONCLUSIONS: The 2PD sensation values for all ﬁngers were higher for the affected site in comparison to the nonaffected site. Conducting three repeatable measurements ensures measurement reliability and repeatability when evaluating 2PD sensation in ﬁngers on both sides in acute stroke patients.},

	abstract = {Two-point discrimination (TPD) has been widely used as a parameter for the examination of higher-order perceptual functions in the ﬁeld of rehabilitation. Previous research has shown that the threshold of TPD increases with aging or pathological conditions such as stroke or chronic pain. It has also been reported that the threshold can be decreased by continuous tactile or electrical stimulation. The cognitive process in the cortex has been shown to be involved in the determination of the TPD threshold. However, the reliability of TPD has been questioned, because diﬀerences in the ﬁring rate of the responding receptors and aﬀerent ﬁbers occur, depending on how the measuring instrument is applied. To investigate the inﬂuence of the stimulus condition on the TPD threshold, we utilized a computer-controlled two-point tactile stimulator and measured the TPD threshold by alternating stimulus speed and stimulus penetration depths. We found that a stimulus speed of 5.0 mm/s or 10.0 mm/s and a stimulus penetration depth of 1.0 mm were the optimum condition for measurement, at which the TPD threshold becomes lowest. We also found that no inﬂuence is exerted on the threshold by repeated measurement under the stimulus conditions utilized in this experiment. Our ﬁndings suggest that TPD measurement should be performed under certain stimulus conditions, as identiﬁed in this present study, to obtain reliable results that reﬂect the highest ability of the subject for spatial discrimination.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the reliability (intra and inter) of two-point discrimination (2PD) test in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) patients. Participants: Eighty-six adults with unilateral right hand CTS. Methods: Two examiners performed measurements of 2PD sensation (using Dellon discriminator) on the first three fingers on both hands. The first examiner performed three series of measurements at 1-minute intervals. After 7 days, measurements were repeated by the same examiner (intra-rater). For inter-rater reliability, the examination (by second examiner) was also repeated after 7 days. Results: For the first measurement, inter-rater reliability (ICC2,1) at the affected site ranged from 0.96 to 0.97; values at the non-affected site ranged from 0.79 to 0.89. Analysis of the averages of two measurements (ICC2,2) yielded values at the affected site of 0.98; values at the non-affected site ranged from 0.92 to 0.94. The average of two measurements reduces the smallest detectable difference (SDD) value {\textless} 1 mm in all cases. Intra-rater reliability was at least good for all tested fingers for the first measurement, but to record SDD {\textless} 1 mm it is necessary to use an average of the first two measurements. Conclusions: The execution of two repeated measurements provides adequate reliability in measurements of 2PD test in CTS patients. For clinical trials, we recommend using at least the average of two measurements of 2PD, which reduce SDD (below 1 mm). This may be particularly important in assessing the effectiveness of therapy.},

	abstract = {Grating orientation discrimination is employed widely to test tactile spatial acuity. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural circuitry underlying performance of this task. Two studies were carried out. In the first study, an extensive set of parietal and frontal cortical areas was activated during covert task performance, relative to a rest baseline. The active regions included the postcentral sulcus bilaterally and foci in the left parietal operculum, left anterior intraparietal sulcus, and bilateral premotor and prefrontal cortex. The second study examined selective recruitment of cortical areas during discrimination of grating orientation (a task with a macrospatial component) compared to discrimination of grating spacing (a purely microspatial task). The foci activated on this contrast were in the left anterior intraparietal sulcus, right postcentral sulcus and gyrus, left parieto-occipital cortex, bilateral frontal eye fields, and bilateral ventral premotor cortex. These findings not only confirm and extend previous studies of the neural processing underlying grating orientation discrimination, but also demonstrate that a distributed network of putatively multisensory areas is involved.

	abstract = {Impaired responses to tactile stimulation are a commonly reported symptom among children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Furthermore, impairments in filtering or habituation to tactile input have been described in ASD. This study measured different aspects of tactile processing to investigate atypical touch sensitivity in children with ASD, methodology that has not been previously used in this population. Sixty-seven typically developing children (TDC) and 32 children with ASD (ages 8–12) completed vibrotactile tasks assessing: reaction time (RT); static and dynamic detection threshold (DT); amplitude discrimination with and without single-site adaptation; frequency discrimination; and temporal order judgment (TOJ) with and without concurrent stimulation. Children with ASD showed raised static detection thresholds and an absence of the effect of a dynamically increasing subthreshold stimulus on static detection threshold. Children with ASD also showed poorer amplitude discrimination than TDC, as well as decreased adaptation. There were no significant differences in frequency discrimination or TOJ performance between the groups. Differences in the effect of dynamic stimulation on detection threshold suggest impaired feed-forward inhibition in autism, which may be linked to poor sensory filtering. Increased baseline amplitude discrimination thresholds in ASD suggest that lateral inhibitory connections are weaker in ASD, and an absence of the effect of adaptation suggests impaired modulation of lateral inhibitory connections in ASD, which may relate to aberrant habituation. These results suggest a functional deficit in the somatosensory inhibitory system in autism. Understanding the specific mechanisms underlying sensory symptoms in autism may allow for more specific therapeutic or drug targeting in the near future.},

	abstract = {Two-point discrimination is widely used to measure tactile spatial acuity. The validity of the two-point threshold as a spatial acuity measure rests on the assumption that two points can be distinguished from one only when the two points are sufﬁciently separated to evoke spatially distinguishable foci of neural activity. However, some previous research has challenged this view, suggesting instead that two-point task performance beneﬁts from an unintended non-spatial cue, allowing spuriously good performance at small tip separations. We compared the traditional two-point task to an equally convenient alternative task in which participants attempt to discern the orientation (vertical or horizontal) of two points of contact. We used precision digital readout calipers to administer two-interval forced-choice versions of both tasks to 24 neurologically healthy adults, on the ﬁngertip, ﬁnger base, palm, and forearm. We used Bayesian adaptive testing to estimate the participants’ psychometric functions on the two tasks. Traditional two-point performance remained signiﬁcantly above chance levels even at zero point separation. In contrast, two-point orientation discrimination approached chance as point separation approached zero, as expected for a valid measure of tactile spatial acuity. Traditional two-point performance was so inﬂated at small point separations that 75\%-correct thresholds could be determined on all tested sites for fewer than half of participants. The 95\%-correct thresholds on the two tasks were similar, and correlated with receptive ﬁeld spacing. In keeping with previous critiques, we conclude that the traditional two-point task provides an unintended non-spatial cue, resulting in spuriously good performance at small spatial separations. Unlike two-point discrimination, two-point orientation discrimination rigorously measures tactile spatial acuity. We recommend the use of two-point orientation discrimination for neurological assessment.},

In psychophysical tests, two-point discrimination thresholds on the hindlimbs of adult cats varied as a function of stimulus location and orientation, as they do in humans. A statistical model of the excitatory low threshold mechanoreceptive fields of spinocervical, postsynaptic dorsal column and spinothalamic tract neurons was used to simulate the population receptive field representations in this neural population of the one- and twopoint stimuli used in the psychophysical experiments. The simulated and observed thresholds were highly correlated. Simulated and observed thresholds’ relations to physiological and anatomical variables such as stimulus location and orientation, receptive field size and shape, map scale, and innervation density were strikingly similar. Simulated and observed threshold variations with receptive field size and map scale obeyed simple relationships predicted by the signal detection model, and were statistically indistinguishable from each other. The population receptive field representation therefore contains information sufficient for this discrimination.},

Four such interactions are described: the link between the body surface and the maps in primary somatosensory cortex, the contribution of somatosensory cortical information to mental body representations, the feedback pathway from such higher representations back to primary tactile processing in somatosensory cortex, and the modulation of tactile object perception by mental body representations.},

	abstract = {The cutaneous senses are traditionally thought to comprise four recognized submodalities that relay tactile, thermal, painful and pruritic (itch) information to the central nervous system, but there is growing evidence for the presence of a fifth modality that conveys positive affective (pleasant) properties of touch. Cutaneous sensory channels can be further classified as serving predominantly either discriminative or affective functions. The former provides information about the spatial and temporal localisation of events on the body surface, e.g., the presence of an insect or the temperature of a cold wind; and the latter, although widely recognised as providing the afferent neural input driving the negative emotional experience of pain, is here posited to provide the afferent neural input driving the positive emotional experience of affiliative touch as well. A distinction is made between the properties of fast conducting myelinated afferents and those of slowly conducting unmyelinated afferents, with the former subserving a sensory-discriminative role, and the latter an affective-motivational one. Here we review the basic elements of the somatosensory system and outline evidence for the inclusion of the ‘fifth’ sub-modality, conveyed by low-threshold C-fiber mechanoreceptors as the counterpart of high-threshold C-fiber nociceptors with both C-fiber systems serving opposing aspects of affective touch, yet underpining a common mechanism for the preservation of self and species.},

Four classes of low-threshold mechanoreceptor afferents innervate the foot sole and transmit feedback that facilitates the conscious and reflexive control of standing balance. Experimental manipulation of cutaneous feedback has been shown to alter the control of gait and standing balance. This has led to a growing interest in the design of intervention strategies that enhance cutaneous feedback and improve postural control. The advent of single-unit microneurography has allowed the firing and receptive field characteristics of foot sole cutaneous afferents to be investigated. In this review, we consolidate the available cutaneous afferent microneurographic recordings from the foot sole and provide an analysis of the firing threshold, and receptive field distribution and density of these cutaneous afferents. This work enhances the understanding of the foot sole as a sensory structure and provides a foundation for the continued development of sensory augmentation insoles and other tactile enhancement interventions.},

Whether abnormalities in tactile acuity are a consistent feature of chronic pain remains largely unknown. The aim of this review was to systematically evaluate the literature and use meta-analysis to establish whether tactile acuity is altered in people with chronic non-neuropathic pain. We systematically searched the literature for studies that investigated tactile acuity in people with chronic non-neuropathic pain and compared it to an appropriate control group. Sixteen studies, reporting data from 5 chronic pain conditions, were included. Data were available for 18 chronic pain populations (n = 484) and 15 control populations (n = 378). Our results suggest that tactile acuity is diminished in arthritis, complex regional pain syndrome, and chronic low back pain but not in burning mouth syndrome. The strength of the available evidence is weakened by somewhat inconsistent results and the high risk of bias observed in all of the included studies.},

Of two measures, the primary one was a threshold for detecting a gap between two points (a refinement of the conventionaltwo-pointthreshold).The secondary one was a threshold of point localization in 7 of these 13 body regions. The two measures yielded similar pictures of body acuity and age-related changes in acuity, and they agreed in essentials with an early acuity map dating back to Weber in 1835, as cited and confirmed experimentallyby Weinstein (1968). To this acuity map, the present study added the dimension of age. The main finding was that aging is much harder on some body regions than on others. Declining acuity with age was found to characterize all regions to one degree or another, but the hands and feet turned out to be far more vulnerable than the more central regions, including the very acute lip and tongue. Deterioration of acuity in the great toe (averaging 400\% between youth and advanced age) and fingertip (averaging 130\%) may adversely affect such diverse activities as braille reading, grasping, and maintaining balance. The acuity map determined by gap discrimination was essentially the same for males and females; however, males gave significantly smaller localization thresholds than females. In two body regions tested (fingertip and upper lip), children significantly outperformed young adults at gap discrimination.},

	abstract = {The development of somatosensation and affective touch acquires a central role throughout our lives, for several reasons. In adults, these functions are driven by different, neuroanatomically and functionally segregated fibres. To date, very little is known about the basic features of these fibres in childhood and this lack of knowledge is mirrored in the affective touch domain, where there are no studies on the main physiological features of the tactile processes linked to the stimulation of the hairy skin, namely the preferential site of affective touch. Thus, our study aims to analyze (1) tactile sensitivity and tactile acuity of children’s hairy forearms; (2) a possible dissociation between somatosensation and the affective touch; and (3) the presence/absence of the perception of affective touch already in childhood. To these aims, participants (160 children, aged 6 to 14 years), were administered with the Von Frey (tactile sensitivity) and the 2 Point Discrimination (tactile acuity) tests. Affective touch was measured following the classic protocol and pleasantness ratings were recorded. Our findings showed a correlation between age and somatosensation, suggesting a progressive reduction of sensitivity and acuity as age grows. Further, there was no overlap between affective touch and somatosensation, suggesting a behavioural segregation. Lastly, we found higher pleasantness ratings for Affective versus Neutral stimulations at all ages and an enhanced preference for Affective as age grows. We concluded that both somatosensation and affective touch are already present as two separate components of touch in childhood and change as a function of age.},

	abstract = {Background: The authors aimed to assess the effect of lower extremity nerve decompression surgery for painful diabetic polyneuropathy on pain and sensibility.
Methods: The study was conducted as a single-center randomized controlled trial of one intervention with 1-year follow-up. Forty-two patients with painful diabetic neuropathy were included. After randomization, the lower extremity nerves were decompressed at four sites in one limb. The contralateral limb was used as control (within-patient comparison). All patients were assessed preoperatively and at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Primary outcome was the visual analogue scale score 12 months after surgery. Secondary outcomes were Semmes Weinstein monofilament testing and two-point discrimination outcomes at 3, 6, and 12 months.
Results: Visual analogue scale scores improved significantly from a mean of 6.1 (95 percent CI, 5.5 to 6.7) preoperatively to 3.5 (95 percent CI, 2.5 to 4.4) at 12 months postoperatively (p {\textless} 0.001). The score was also significantly lower compared with the control leg score of 5.3 (95 percent CI, 4.4 to 6.2; p {\textless} 0.001) at 12 months. Overall, 73.7 percent of the patients improved their score on the visual analogue scale, of which 35.7 percent had a decrease of more than five points.
Conclusion: Surgical decompression of the nerves of the lower extremity can be added as a therapeutic option for patients with painful diabetic neuropathy who show signs of chronic nerve compression by means of a positive Tinel or other diagnostic criteria, when pain medication fails to reduce pain to an acceptable standard.  (Plast.

	abstract = {Background Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common cause of polyneuropathy. The aim of the present study was to evaluate two-point discrimination (TPD) compared with nerve conduction studies in the early stages of DM. Methods Forty-eight patients with early diagnosed ({\textless}5 years) type 2 DM and 17 healthy controls were evaluated. Of the patients with DM, 26 had neuropathic pain and 22 were asymptomatic. TPD and electrophysiological evaluations was obtained for all subjects. Results Nerve conduction studies in patients showed findings related to both demyelination and axonal damage. Patients with neuropathic pain had higher TPD values on the plantar surface of the foot and both groups of DM patients had higher TPD values on the outer lateral malleolus compared with the control group (P {\textless} 0.05). There was a correlation between TPD and axonal damage in patients with neuropathic pain (P {\textless} 0.05). In patients without neuropathic pain, there was a correlation between TPD values and distal latencies of motor or sensory nerves (P {\textless} 0.05). In the control group, only third digit TPD values were related to the distal motor latency of the median nerve (P {\textless} 0.05). Conclusion In conclusion, the TPD method is a less painful, practical, costeffective, and more easily applicable method that was completed in less timethan nerve conduction studies. Higher TPD values in the lower extremities indicate nerve damage in patients. These findings suggest that increased TPD values can easily determine neuropathy starting in the early stages of diabetes in patients with DM.},

	abstract = {Background: Diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN) is the commonest form of neuropathy. Loss of sensations in sole leads to diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) and its complications. Surgical decompression has been used in the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, however; its effectiveness has been questioned. Purpose of this study was to evaluate the sensory recovery in sole after tarsal tunnel decompression (TTD) in patients having DSPN.
Methods: Thirteen patients (Age28-70 years, average 35.57 years; 7 Males, 6 Females; 20 feet) with DSPN and positive Tinel's sign over the tarsal tunnel were included in the study. Pre and post-operative sensory tests performed on the sole included tests for touch, pain, temperature, pressure, vibration perception threshold (VPT) and two-point discrimination (2-PD). Results were classiﬁed as per British Medical Research Council (MRC) scoring system.
Results: eSixteen feet were followed-up for 6 months. In all feet perception of touch, pain and pressure recovered. Temperature perception recovered in 75\% feet. VPT came to normal range (16.81V) from 40.37 V and 2-PD came down to average of 6.0 mm from preoperative average of11.2 mm.MRC scale improved from S0 in 5 feet and S2 in 15 feet to S3þ in all 16 feet.There were no ulcers or amputation in operated limbs during follow up period of 6 months.
Conclusions: TTD improves plantar sensations in diabetic neuropathy and prevents ulcers and its related complications.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate the effect of surgical decompression on painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) patients and discuss the role which pain distribution and characterization play in the management of painful DPN as well as the underlying mechanism involved.
Methods: A total of 306 patients with painful diabetic lower-extremity neuropathy were treated with Dellon surgical nerve decompression in our department. Clinical evaluation including Visual analogue scale (VAS), Brief Pain Inventory Short Form for diabetic peripheral neuropathy (BPI-DPN) questionnaire, two-point discrimination (2-PD), nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and high-resolution ultrasonography (cross-sectional area, CSA) were performed in all cases preoperatively, and at 6 month intervals for 2 years post-decompression. The patients who underwent surgery were retrospectively assigned into two subgroups (focal and diffuse pain) according to the distribution of the diabetic neuropathic pain. The control group included 92 painful DPN patients without surgery.
Results: The levels of VAS, scores in BPI-DPN, 2-PD, NCV results and CSA were all improved in surgical group when compared to the control group (P,0.05). More improvement of VAS, scores in BPI-DPN and CSA was observed in focal pain group than that in diffuse group (P,0.05).
Conclusions: Efficacy of decompression of multiple lower-extremity peripheral nerves in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy was confirmed in this study. While both focal and diffuse group could benefit from surgical decompression, pain relief and morphological restoration could be better achieved in focal group.},

	abstract = {Diabetic neuropathy traditionally is considered progressive and irreversible and will result in lower extremity ulceration and amputation in a segment of the diabetic population, despite the best efforts to control serum glucose levels. Restoration of sensation to the diabetic may prevent these complications of neuropathy. The present study was designed to evaluate whether decompression of a peripheral nerve at a known site of anatomic narrowing can restore sensibility to that nerve in the diabetic. Twenty diabetic patients (14 type I, 6 type II, with a mean duration of diabetes of 14.8 years) had surgical decompression of a median nerve at the wrist and an ulnar nerve at the elbow, or a decompression of the posterior tibial nerve at the ankle (total of 31 nerves). A therapist, in a manner blind to the operative site, evaluated two-point discrimination in the pulp of the appropriate digit. The postoperative sensibility was compared with that of the nontreated, contralateral extremity. At a mean of 23.3 months, 69 percent of the lower-extremity nerves and 88 percent of the upper-extremity nerves (79 percent overall) had improvement in sensibility. In comparison, 32 percent of the control (not decompressed) contralateral nerves had measurable progression of neuropathy. The hypothesis that decompression of a peripheral nerve in the diabetic will improve sensibility was confirmed at the p {\textless} 0.001 level. (Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 106: 816, 2000.)},

The aim of this study is to investigate if decision tree modelling is able to reduce the number of tests needed in estimating pedal sensation. Methods The 39-item RDF Study Test Battery (RDF-39) scores were collected from the prospective RDF study and included baseline (n = 416), first follow-up (n = 364), and second follow-up (n = 135) measurements, supplemented with cross-sectional control data from a previous study (n = 196). Decision tree analysis was used to predict total RDF-39 scores using individual test item data. The tree was developed using baseline RDF study data and validated in follow-up and control data. Spearman correlation coefficients assessed the reliability between the decision tree and original RDF-39. Results The tree reduced the number of items from 39 to 3 in estimating the RDF-39 sum score. M2PD (hallux), S2PD (first dorsal web, fifth toe), vibration sense (interphalangeal joint), and S1PD (first dorsal web, fifth toe) measurements proved to be predictive. The correlation coefficients to original scores were high (0.76 to 0.91). Conclusions The decision tree was successful at reducing the number of RDF Test Battery items to only 3, with high correlation coefficients to the scores of the full test battery.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aim of this study is to evaluate ankle joint position sense (JPS) in the diabetic patients without peripheral neuropathy (PN). The hypothesis was that diabetes would lead to decreased JPS even if there was no PN.
METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with diabetes and 22 healthy controls were included in the study. PN was detected with the use of Semmes-Weinstein Monoﬁlament test (SWMT), vibration testing by the timed method (128 Hz diapason) and two point discrimination sensation test. JPS was measured as the subjects’ ability to actively reproduce target ankle dorsiﬂexion (DF) and plantarﬂexion (PF). The concentric isokinetic peak torques of the ankle DF and PF were recorded using the Biodex R System 3 Dynamometer.
RESULTS: JPS was signiﬁcantly lower in diabetic patients than control subjects. PF isokinetic muscle torque at 30◦/s, 60◦/s and 180◦/s was signiﬁcantly lower in diabetic patients than control subjects but DF muscle torque did not differ between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic patients displayed decreased ankle joint position sense and muscle torque even though they had no peripheral neuropathy.

Methods One hundred and fifty-nine patients with clinically defined DM were included. Semmes–Weinstein monofilament, static two-point discrimination and moving two-point discrimination, maximal pinch strength precision pinch performance tests and nerve conduction studies (NCS) of the subjects were carried out. Forty-seven (29.6\%) patients were in the HbA1c {\textless} 7\% category, and 112 (70.4\%) patients were in the {\textgreater}7\% group. There were 87 (54.7\%) patients with the disease duration {\textless}10 years, and 72 (45.3\%) patients with disease duration ≧10 years. Results The severity of hyperglycaemia significantly impacts the results for Semmes–Weinstein monofilament, precision pinch force control, sensory and motor NCS tests (p {\textless} 0.05). In addition, the chronicity of disease influences the motor control of precision pinch performance and the amplitude of motor NCS (p {\textless} 0.05) for the diabetes patients. Conclusions The evidence suggests that disease chronicity and hyperglycaemia have impacts on sensorimotor control in the hands of DM patients. In addition, the efficiency of prehensile forces of hand-to-object interactions in the pinch-holding-up activity test could be significant for identifying hand function, as well as pathologic changes in median nerve function, for patients with DM.

The precision, sensitivity and specificity of the PHUA test in the measurements of diabetic patients were also analyzed. We hypothesized that the diabetic hands would have impacts on the sensorimotor functions of the hand performances under functionally quantitative measurements. One hundred and fifty-nine patients with clinically defined diabetes mellitus (DM) and 95 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were included. Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (SWM), static and moving two-point discrimination (S2PD and M2PD), maximal pinch strength and precision pinch performance tests were conducted to evaluate the sensation, motor and sensorimotor status of the recruited hands. The results showed that there were significant differences (all p,0.05) in SWM, S2PD, M2PD and maximum pinch strength between the DM and control groups. A higher force ratio in the DM patients than in the controls (p,0.001) revealed a poor ability of pinch force adjustment in the DM patients. The percentage of maximal pinch strength was also significantly different (p,0.001) between the DM and control groups. The sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.85, 0.51, and 0.724, respectively, for the PHUA test. Statistically significant degradations in sensory and motor functions and sensorimotor control ability were observed in the hands of the diabetic patients.

Methods Out of 58 patients, diagnosed at the age of 15–25 years and recruited 1984–1985, 32 patients (13 women, median age 52 years, range 44–75 years; 19 men, median age 52 years, range 39–69 years; median duration 33.5 years, range 21–52 years) accepted follow-up in 2006. Vibration thresholds were measured in finger pulps of index and little fingers bilaterally at seven frequencies and related to results of touch (monofilaments), tactile discrimination (two-point discrimination test), electrophysiology (median nerve function), glycaemic level (HbA1c levels since 1984–1985) and a clinical score. Results Vibrotactile sense was reduced in finger pulps, mainly in men, compared with an age- and gender-matched healthy control group with normal HbA1c. Vibration thresholds were increased, particularly at 250 and 500 Hz, in both index and little finger pulps. Touch and tactile discrimination correlated with vibration thresholds, but not with each other or with electrophysiology. HbA1c levels (at follow-up or mean values from five follow-ups since recruitment) did not correlate with any nerve function variables. Clinical scores correlated with vibrotactile sense, particularly at higher frequencies ({\textgreater} 125 Hz), but not with total Z-scores of electrophysiology. Duration of disease did not correlate with any variables. Conclusions Examination of vibration thresholds in index and little finger pulps may be valuable to detect neuropathy, where thresholds correlate with symptoms and tests.},

	abstract = {Background Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common cause of polyneuropathy. The aim of the present study was to evaluate two-point discrimination (TPD) compared with nerve conduction studies in the early stages of DM. Methods Forty-eight patients with early diagnosed ({\textless}5 years) type 2 DM and 17 healthy controls were evaluated. Of the patients with DM, 26 had neuropathic pain and 22 were asymptomatic. TPD and electrophysiological evaluations was obtained for all subjects. Results Nerve conduction studies in patients showed findings related to both demyelination and axonal damage. Patients with neuropathic pain had higher TPD values on the plantar surface of the foot and both groups of DM patients had higher TPD values on the outer lateral malleolus compared with the control group (P {\textless} 0.05). There was a correlation between TPD and axonal damage in patients with neuropathic pain (P {\textless} 0.05). In patients without neuropathic pain, there was a correlation between TPD values and distal latencies of motor or sensory nerves (P {\textless} 0.05). In the control group, only third digit TPD values were related to the distal motor latency of the median nerve (P {\textless} 0.05). Conclusion In conclusion, the TPD method is a less painful, practical, costeffective, and more easily applicable method that was completed in less timethan nerve conduction studies. Higher TPD values in the lower extremities indicate nerve damage in patients. These findings suggest that increased TPD values can easily determine neuropathy starting in the early stages of diabetes in patients with DM.},

	abstract = {Background: Diabetic neuropathy is a family of nerve disorders with progressive loss of nerve function in 15\% of diabetes mellitus (DM) subjects. Two-point discrimination (TPD) is one method of quantitatively testing for loss of nerve function. The law of mobility for TPD is known for normal subjects in earlier studies but has not been studied for diabetic subjects. This is a pilot study to evaluate and plot the law of mobility for TPD among DM subjects.
Methods: The Semmes Weinstein monofilament (SWMF) was used to measure the loss of protective sensation. An Aesthesiometer was used to find the TPD of several areas in upper and lower extremities for normal and diabetic subjects. All the subjects were screened for peripheral artery occlusive disease with ankle brachial pressure index (0.9 or above).
Results: TPD of normal and diabetic subjects for different areas of hands and legs from proximal to distal is evaluated for 18 subjects. TPD values decrease from proximal to distal areas. Vierodt's law of mobility for TPD holds good for normal subjects in the hand and foot areas. The law of mobility for TPD in DM subjects holds well in the hand but doesn't hold well in foot areas with or without sensation.
Conclusion: TPD is a quantitative and direct measure of sensory loss. The TPD value of diabetic subjects reveals that the law of mobility do not hold well for Diabetic subjects in foot areas. The significance of this result is that the TPD of the diabetic subjects could provide direct, cost effective and quantitative measure of neuropathy.},

Among different sensibility measures of neuropathy, two-point discrimination (TPD) has been suggested as a reliable method; however, the correlation of TPD with other well-known measures is not known. We measured the loss of protective sensation using Semmes-Weinstein Monofilaments (SWMF), hardness of the foot sole using shore meter (sh), power ratio (PR) using pedopowergraph and TPD using esthesiometer in foot areas of both left and right legs in 14 DM subjects. We have found no correlation either between TPD and shore values (sh) or between TPD and PR. The SWMF (10 g) is found not to provide any additional value in measuring loss of sensation in comparison to TPD. The TPD appears to be measuring different property of the foot compared to other measures. The mechanism of this independence is not well understood and more investigation is required to understand the mechanism.},

The chapter discusses the various forms of psychometric functions that are commonly in use and considers how internal sensory processes are related to the psychometric function according to both High-Threshold Theory and Signal Detection Theory. Two methods for estimating the parameter values of the psychometric function and their variability are treated in great detail: Maximum likelihood fitting and Bayesian fitting. The chapter also discusses how to determine the goodness-of-fit of a psychometric function. Use of Palamedes routines that implement the various procedures is explained by examples. The Weibull family of psychometric functions, the lapse rate, and how to avoid failed fits are examined in detail.},

Methods: A partially cross-sectional cohort study was carried out in patients with diabetes.

Results: One hundred fifty-five diabetic patients were measured. Fifteen patients had a diabetic ulcer in their medical history, seven patients were insensate to the 10-g monofilament and had diminished vibration sense (group 1), 34 patients had diminished vibration sense but no elevated cutaneous threshold (group 2), and 99 patients acted as controls (no elevated cutaneous threshold or diminished vibration sense, group 3).

	abstract = {The current study sought to determine if somatosensory deviations, assessed by determining two-point discrimination thresholds, were associated with schizotypic features in non-psychotic subjects (N=100). It was hypothesized that elevated two-point discrimination thresholds would be associated with an increased likelihood of higher levels of schizotypy features. The results of the study suggested that at the level of individual diﬀerences, higher two-point discrimination thresholds (ascending series assessments) were associated with higher levels of schizotypy as operationalized by several prominent measures of schizotypy. A deviant subgroup analysis clearly suggested that, for ascending series two-point threshold assessments, those persons requiring the greatest distance (i.e. highest thresholds) to detect two-point stimulation were substantially more schizotypic than a contrast group. Control analyses that focused on psychological state (depression, anxiety) and intellectual functioning variables revealed that these factors were, more or less, unrelated to two-point discrimination thresholds and they did not account for the observed signiﬁcant relations between the schizotypy scales and two-point threshold values.

While use of a bent paperclip with a specified intertip distance as the assessment device has been described, no research has been performed on the accuracy of setting this distance by hand and eye alone. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate this accuracy. Methods: Five orthopaedic registrars, four residents and three clinic nurses performed static and dynamic two-point discrimination testing on each other. They set the tip distance by hand and eye by bending a paperclip such that the distance between the two ends was their best approximation of 5 mm and then 10 mm. The testing was repeated after 7 days, n = 264 for each tip distance. Results: Two-sample t-tests showed no significant difference (P {\textgreater} 0.53−0.93) between tip distance setting performed by registrars, nurses and residents; while single sample t-test showed a statistically significant difference (P {\textless} 0.0001) between the attempted tip distance and the overall mean tip distance achieved at 5 mm and 10 mm. Conclusion: Statistical analysis showed that the single sample t-test could be discarded. Static and dynamic two-point discrimination testing with a paperclip set by hand and eye is therefore an accurate and reproducible test capable of being administered by both medical and non-medical staff, and is suitable for inclusion in a peripheral nerve repair testing protocol.},

	abstract = {In assessing the prospects for surgical and other kinds of rehabilitation in tetraplegia and stroke patients the two-point discrimination test, correctly performed by experienced examiners, is of great value. Valid and repeatable results depend on exact technique and proper tools. There is a firm correlation between the thresholds of two-point discrimination on the pulps of the fingers and the accuracy of position sense at the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints. Microneurography has shown that cutaneous receptors have proprioceptive as well as exteroceptive functions. Thus the two-point discrimination test can be used as a measure of proprioceptive function. The results can be expressed numerically. A two-point threshold less than 10 mm on the pulp is a valid measure of useful finger proprioception. It also shows tactile gnosis, necessary for precision sensory grips.},

	abstract = {Twenty-eight right-handed, young adults participated in a sensory testing experiment to evaluate spatial resolution at 10 positionally matched sites on the right- and left-hand sides of the face. An adaptive psychophysical (i.e. tracking) procedure was used to estimate the threshold spatial separation for perceiving two points of contact at each site. Estimates of the threshold at one site on both sides of the face were also obtained with a method-of-limits procedure similar to that employed for clinical evaluation of patients. In addition, each individual was asked to rate (i) his(her) overall facial sensitivity to touch and (ii) the degree to which he(she) could discern subtle changes in lip, cheek and chin position during speech, chewing and facial expression. Analysis of the estimates of the threshold separation obtained with the tracking procedure revealed a significant effect of gender (p {\textless} 0.04) and of site (p {\textless} 0.001). Females were more spatially sensitive than males: average threshold separations were 1.55 mm less. Most notably, the threshold increased ninefold with distance posterolaterally from the oral opening. The vermilion of the upper lip was the most spatially sensitive site (population geometric mean = 2.4 mm) and the preauricular skin the least spatially sensitive site (20.9 mm). Significant effects of side and of interactions among gender, side and site were not observed. The estimates obtained with the method-oflimits procedure were very similar to those obtained with the tracking procedure: the latter were 0.67 mm less on the average. Individuals' ratings of overall facial sensitivity to touch were similar for males and females (p {\textgreater} 0.70). Females, however, reported greater ability to discern subtle changes in lip, cheek and chin position than males (p {\textless} 0.03). The ratings of this sensory function correlated negatively with the estimates of the threshold separation on the vermilion of the upper lip (p {\textless} 0.03).},

	abstract = {Theories of scientific and technological change view discovery and invention as endogenous processes1,2, wherein previous accumulated knowledge enables future progress by allowing researchers to, in Newton’s words, ‘stand on the shoulders of giants’3–7. Recent decades have witnessed exponential growth in the volume of new scientific and technological knowledge, thereby creating conditions that should be ripe for major advances8,9. Yet contrary to this view, studies suggest that progress is slowing in several major fields10,11. Here, we analyse these claims at scale across six decades, using data on 45 million papers and 3.9 million patents from six large-scale datasets, together with a new quantitative metric—the CD index12—that characterizes how papers and patents change networks of citations in science and technology. We find that papers and patents are increasingly less likely to break with the past in ways that push science and technology in new directions. This pattern holds universally across fields and is robust across multiple different citation- and text-based metrics1,13–17. Subsequently, we link this decline in disruptiveness to a narrowing in the use of previous knowledge, allowing us to reconcile the patterns we observe with the ‘shoulders of giants’ view. We find that the observed declines are unlikely to be driven by changes in the quality of published science, citation practices or field-specific factors. Overall, our results suggest that slowing rates of disruption may reflect a fundamental shift in the nature of science and technology.},

Of the 71 patients, 37 were allocated to the HBO group and 34 to the control (normal air) group. Both groups received 15 therapy sessions in a hyperbaric chamber. Pain, oedema and range of motion (ROM) of the wrist were evaluated before treatment, after the 15th treatment session and on day 45. In the HBO group there was a significant decrease in pain and oedema and a significant increase in the ROM of the wrist. When we compared the two groups, the HBO group had significantly better results with the exception of wrist extension. In conclusion, HBO is an effective and well-tolerated method for decreasing pain and oedema and increasing the ROM in patients with CRPS.},

There are several treatment methods but none has been specifically approved for this application. We conducted a randomized controlled study to evaluate the effect of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy in FMS (HBO group: n = 26; control group: n = 24). Tender points and pain threshold were assessed before, and after the first and fifteenth sessions of therapy. Pain was also scored on a visual analogue scale (VAS). There was a significant reduction in tender points and VAS scores and a significant increase in pain threshold of the HBO group after the first and fifteenth therapy sessions. There was also a significant difference between the HBO and control groups for all parameters except the VAS scores after the first session. We conclude that HBO therapy has an important role in managing FMS.},

	abstract = {The psychometric properties of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) were evaluated in a normal sample of N = 717 who were also administered the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The DASS was shown to possess satisfactory psychometric properties, and the factor structure was substantiated both by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. In comparison to the BDI and BAI, the DASS scales showed greater separation in factor loadings. The DASS Anxiety scale correlated 0.81 with the BAI, and the DASS Depression scale correlated 0.74 with the BDI. Factor analyses suggested that the BDI differs from the DASS Depression scale primarily in that the BDI includes items such as weight loss, insomnia, somatic preoccupation and irritability, which fail to discriminate between depression and other affective states. The factor structure of the combined BDI and BAI items was virtually identical to that reported by Beck for a sample of diagnosed depressed and anxious patients, supporting the view that these clinical states are more severe expressions of the same states that may be discerned in normals. Implications of the results for the conceptualisation of depression, anxiety and tension/stress are considered, and the utility of the DASS scales in discriminating between these constructs is discussed.},
